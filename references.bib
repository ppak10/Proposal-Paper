	abstract = {This paper describes a deep-learning-based method for porosity monitoring in laser additive manufacturing process. A high-speed digital camera was mounted coaxially to the process laser beam for in-process sensing of melt-pool data, and convolutional neural network models were designed to learn melt-pool features to predict the porosity attributes in deposited specimens during laser additive manufacturing. With the image processing tools developed in this paper, the extraction of porosity information from raw quality inspection data, such as cross-section images and tomography data sets, can be automated. The CNN models with a compact architecture, part of whose hyperparameters were selected through cross-validation analysis, achieved a classification accuracy of 91.2\% for porosity occurrence detection in the direct laser deposition of sponge Titanium powders and presented predictive capacity for micro pores below 100 μm. For local volume porosity prediction, the model also achieved a root mean square error of 1.32\% and exhibited high fidelity for both high porosity and low porosity specimens.},

	abstract = {In aerospace engineering, many additive manufacturing (AM) metal parts subject to fatigue loadings, resulting in their fatigue failure. Therefore, it is essential to develop an advanced approach for fatigue issues. Although some theoretical methods are used for fatigue analysis of AM metal parts, their implementations are time-consuming. Furthermore, these methods cannot directly consider the effects of AM parameters. In this study, a platform is developed for a data-driven analysis of continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based fatigue life prediction of AM stainless steel (SS) 316L, in which the effects of AM process parameters (including laser power P, scan speed v, hatch space h, powder layer thickness t) are considered. Here, three typical ML models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), and a support vector machine (SVM), are trained effectively by a database produced by the CDM technique, and then further comparisons are made between the predicted results and published experimental data to verify the proposed platform. Finally, detailed parametric studies using the ML models are conducted to investigate some of the significant characteristics.},

We observe that the Transformer training is in general more stable compared to the LSTM, although it also seems to overfit more, and thus shows more problems with generalization. We also find that two initial LSTM layers in the Transformer encoder provide a much better positional encoding. Data-augmentation, a variant of SpecAugment, helps to improve both the Transformer by 33\% and the LSTM by 15\% relative. We analyze several pretraining and scheduling schemes, which is crucial for both the Transformer and the LSTM models. We improve our LSTM model by additional convolutional layers. We perform our experiments on Lib-riSpeech 1000h, Switchboard 300h and TED-LIUM-v2 200h, and we show state-of-the-art performance on TED-LIUM-v2 for attention based end-to-end models. We deliberately limit the training on LibriSpeech to 12.5 epochs of the training data for comparisons, to keep the results of practical interest, although we show that longer training time still improves more. We publish all the code and setups to run our experiments.},

The conventional SLM process is carried out in an inert gas filled chamber, at slightly greater pressure than ambient, to avoid oxidation at high temperature. However, the inert gas may cause pores in as-fabricated parts. In this study, the SLM process was carried out under vacuum in order to improve the quality of the SLM-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples. The as-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples then were subjected to hot-isostatic pressure (HIP). The remaining porosity was evaluated using X-ray computed tomography (CT). The microstructures and mechanical properties of the samples were evaluated with and without HIP. The test results showed that SLM under vacuum could reduce the porosity of Ti6Al4V samples, compared to material that was produced using the conventional SLM process. After HIP, porosity could be further reduced and the Ti6Al4V samples could achieve better elongation.},

However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to produce components with sound structure and good mechanical properties using additive manufacturing by a trial-and-error approach. To obtain optimal process conditions, numerous experiments are needed to optimize the process variables within given machines and processes. Digital twins (DT) are defined as a digital representation of a production system or service or just an active unique product characterized by certain properties or conditions. They are the potential solution to assist in overcoming many issues in additive manufacturing, in order to improve part quality and shorten the time to qualify products. The DT system could be very helpful to understand, analyze and improve the product, service system or production. However, the development of genuine DT is still impeded due to lots of factors, such as the lack of a thorough understanding of the DT concept, framework, and development methods. Moreover, the linkage between existing brownfield systems and their data are under development. This paper aims to summarize the current status and issues in DT for additive manufacturing, in order to provide more references for subsequent research on DT systems.},

The influences of hatch spacing (H) on the thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and resultant surface quality of molten pool have been discussed in detail. The results revealed that the H had a significant influence on determining the terminally solidified surface quality of the SLM-processed components. As a relatively lower H of 40μm was used, a considerable amount of molten liquid migrated towards the previous as-fabricated tracks with a higher velocity, resulting in a stacking of molten liquid and the attendant formation of a poor surface quality with a large average surface roughness of 12.72μm. As an appropriate H of 60μm was settled, a reasonable temperature gradient and the resultant surface tension tended to spread the molten liquid with a steady velocity, favoring the formation of a flat surface of the component and an attendant low average surface roughness of 2.23μm. Both the surface morphologies and average surface roughness were experimentally obtained, which were in a full accordance with the results calculated by simulation.},

	abstract = {Driven by improved architectures and better representation learning frameworks, the field of visual recognition has enjoyed rapid modernization and performance boost in the early 2020s. For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt, have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9\% accuracy using only public training data.},

Critical quality issues such as porosity, surface roughness, crack, and delamination continue to present challenges within SLM-manufactured parts. Monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis are the key to improving the final part quality. Currently, it greatly hinders the adaptability and the development within the defect detection system since the setup restricts the vision and photo diode applications in the SLM process monitoring. Additionally, defect detection with traditional classification approaches makes the system rather complex due to introducing a series of steps. To meet these needs, this study proposes a novel method for the defect detection within the SLM parts. The setup was flexibly conducted using a microphone, and the defect detection was obtained by the framework of deep belief network (DBN). It is implemented by a simplified classification structure without signal preprocessing and feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the utilization of acoustic signals was workable for quality monitoring, and the DBN approach could reach high defect detection rate among five melted states without signal preprocessing.},

The simulation results present the instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the instant bubble pinning on the solidification front. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. Additionally, the simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.},

	abstract = {Cobalt chromium is widely used to make medical implants and wind turbine, engine and aircraft components because of its high wear and corrosion resistance. The ability to process geometrically complex components is an area of intense interest to enable shifting from traditional manufacturing techniques to additive manufacturing (AM). The major reason for using AM is to ease design modification and optimization since AM machines can directly apply the changes from an updated STL file to print a geometrically complex object. Quality assurance for AM fabricated parts is recognized as a critical limitation of AM processes. In selective laser melting (SLM), layer by layer melting and remelting can lead to porosity defects caused by lack of fusion, balling, and keyhole collapse. Machine process parameter optimization becomes a very important task and is usually accomplished by producing a large amount of experimental coupons with different combinations of process parameters such as laser power, speed, hatch spacing, and powder layer thickness. In order to save the cost and time of these experimental trial and error methods, many researchers have attempted to simulate defect formation in SLM. Many physics-based assumptions must be made to model these processes, and thus, all the models are limited in some aspects. In the present work, we investigated single bead melt pool shapes for SLM of CoCr to tune the physics assumptions and then, applied to the model to predict bulk lack of fusion porosity within the finished parts. The simulation results were compared and validated against experimental results and show a high degree of correlation.},

The depositions are scanned using x-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) with a 4.13 micron voxel, and void size and location are recorded. XCT void data is then compared to the thermal analysis to determine the efficacy of the anomaly detection technique. In this build, four voids {\textgreater} 40 microns in diameter were found with XCT. Three defects appeared in the interfacial region between the deposit and substrate and produced signatures that were detected by analyzing the in-situ pyrometer data.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

In this work, acoustic measurements recorded during laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) were used to detect the onset of keyhole pores induced by the lasing process. Post-build radiography was used to identify the locations of keyhole pores in the build. The pore locations were spatially and temporally registered with the recorded time-series of laser position and acoustic pressure to identify specific partitions of the acoustic signals which correspond to pore formation. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, traditional Fourier decomposition, and statistical measures of the time-series and corresponding frequency spectra were used to extract feature vectors which correlate to keyhole pore formation. Sequential feature selection revealed that measures associated with the acoustic spectra were most useful for identifying pore formations in L-PBF. A subset of the most informative data features was used to train a support vector machine model to predict pore formation with up to 97\% accuracy.},

Powder bed fusion (PBF) is one of the most common AM techniques. It sequentially processes a powdered feedstock in thin layers and solidifies it by either a laser beam or an electron beam. However, PBF induces microstructural defects that can adversely affect the performance of the manufactured components. These undesirable defects including voids and porosities must be avoided or minimized to limit their negative effects on mechanical properties and to ensure the consistency and repeatability of AM parts. The present article provides an overview of the formation mechanisms of pores in AM metals and some emerging techniques for the detection and quantification of pores.

	abstract = {With the advance of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, complex designs can be created with engineering metals. One specific advantage of this greater design space is the ability to create small internal channels and passageways for cooling high heat flux or temperature applications such as electronics and gas turbine airfoils. These applications can have complex shapes, which when coupled with the required small channel sizes, make traditional finishing processes a challenge for additively manufactured parts. Therefore, it is desirable for designers to be able to use AM parts with small internal channels that are as-built. To achieve this goal, however, designers must know how the AM process affects internal channel tolerances and roughness levels, since both impact the amount of cooling that can be achieved in actual applications. In this study, the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process, more generically referred to as selective laser melting (SLM), was used to additively manufacture test coupons. The AM build direction was varied to study its effect on small microsized, circular channels. Specifically, X-ray computed tomography (CT-scan) was used to nondestructively inspect the interior of the test coupons. Using the data from the CT-scans, internal surface roughness, geometric tolerances, and deviations from the computer-aided design (CAD) model were calculated. In comparing the data, significant differences were seen between the three different build directions.},

These issues can be alleviated by our proposed NormFormer architecture, which adds three normalization operations to each layer: a Layer Norm after self attention, head-wise scaling of self-attention outputs, and a Layer Norm after the first fully connected layer. The extra operations incur negligible compute cost (+0.4\% parameter increase), but improve pretraining perplexity and downstream task performance for both causal and masked language models ranging from 125 Million to 2.7 Billion parameters. For example, adding NormFormer on top of our strongest 1.3B parameter baseline can reach equal perplexity 24\% faster, or converge 0.27 perplexity better in the same compute budget. This model reaches GPT3-Large (1.3B) zero shot performance 60\% faster. For masked language modeling, NormFormer improves fine-tuned GLUE performance by 1.9\% on average.

While some standards and specifications for documenting the various aspects of AM processes and materials exist and continue to evolve, many such standards still need to be matured or are under consideration/development within standards development organizations. An important subset of this evolving the standardization domain has to do with critical property measurements for AM materials. While such measurement procedures are well documented, with various legacy standards for conventional metallic material forms such as cast or wrought structural alloys, many fewer standards are currently available to enable systematic evaluation of those properties in AM-processed metallic materials. This is due in part to the current lack of AM-specific standards and specifications for AM materials and processes, which are a logical precursor to the material characterization standards for any material system. This paper summarizes some of the important standardization activities, as well as limitations associated with using currently available standards for metal AM with a focus on measuring mission-critical properties. Technical considerations in support of future standards development, as well as a pathway for qualification/certification of AM parts enabled by the appropriate standardization landscape, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs).
Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood.
The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift".
In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm.
Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother.
This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

	abstract = {Porosity is an inherent attribute in selective laser melting (SLM) and profoundly degrades the build part quality and its performance. This study attempts to understand and characterize the keyhole pores formed during single-track scanning in SLM. First, 24 single tracks were generated using different line energy density (LED) levels, ranging from 0.1 J/mm to 0.98 J/mm, by varying the laser power and the scanning speed. The samples were then scanned by micro-computed tomography to measure keyhole pores and analyze the pore characteristics. The results show a general trend that the severity of the keyhole porosity increases with the increase of the LED with exceptions of certain patterns, implying important individual contributions from the parameters. Next, by keeping the LED constant in another set of experiments, different combinations of the power and the speed were tested to investigate the individual effect. Based on the results obtained, the laser power appears to have a greater effect than the scanning speed on both the pore number and the pore volume as well as the pore depth. For the same LED, the pore number and volume increase with increasing laser power until a certain critical level, beyond which, both the pore number and volume will decrease, if the power is further increased. For the LED of 0.32 J/mm, 0.4 J/mm, and 0.48 J/mm, the critical laser power that reverses the trend is about 132 W, 140 W, and 144 W, respectively.},

While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM.

The transformer backbone processes representations at a constant and relatively high resolution and has a global receptive field at every stage. These properties allow the dense vision transformer to provide finer-grained and more globally coherent predictions when compared to fully-convolutional networks. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements on dense prediction tasks, especially when a large amount of training data is available. For monocular depth estimation, we observe an improvement of up to 28\% in relative performance when compared to a state-of-the-art fully-convolutional network. When applied to semantic segmentation, dense vision transformers set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02\% mIoU. We further show that the architecture can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets such as NYUv2, KITTI, and Pascal Context where it also sets the new state of the art.

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has several possible advantages over traditional manufacturing including increased design freedom, reduced material usage, and shorter lead-times. A noteworthy capability of AM is the ability to monitor the process during material deposition and interrupt the process during fabrication if necessary. Recently, such monitoring, feedback, and control have been made possible by implementing in situ infrared (IR) thermography in powder bed fusion AM technologies. The purpose of the current research was to investigate the acquisition of absolute surface temperatures using in situ IR imaging of the melted or solid surfaces layer-by-layer during fabrication within an electron beam melting (EBM) system. The thermal camera was synchronized with the system's signal voltages of three synchronized events (pre-heating, melting, and raking) to automatically capture images. To acquire absolute temperature values from the IR images, a calibration procedure was established to determine the solid material's emissivity and reflected temperature or mean radiant temperature of the build chamber, which are necessary input parameters for the IR camera. A blackbody radiator was fabricated via EBM and was used as a tool to determine the emissivity of Ti–6Al–4V (determined to be 0.26 in the temperature range of the current study). Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to determine the view factors associated with the system's interior (e.g. heat shielding) that were used in calculating the mean radiant temperature of the manufacturing environment (∼342°C). Experimental validation of the model was performed using a thermocouple embedded during fabrication that showed a 3.77\% difference in temperature. A temperature difference of ∼366°C (1038°C vs. 672°C) was observed when comparing uncorrected IR temperature data with corrected temperature data. Upon validation of the IR parameters for a melted area, experimentation was conducted to also determine powder emissivity (found to be 0.50). The thermal model presented here can be modified and implemented in other AM technologies for consideration of radiation energy to acquire absolute temperatures of layered surfaces, leading to improved thermal monitoring and control of the fabrication process.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), an enabler of Industry 4.0, recently opened limitless possibilities in various sectors covering personal, industrial, medical, aviation and even extra-terrestrial applications. Although significant research thrust is prevalent on this topic, a detailed review covering the impact, status, and prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector has been ignored in the literature. Therefore, this review provides comprehensive information on smart mechanisms and systems emphasizing additive, subtractive and/or hybrid manufacturing processes in a collaborative, predictive, decisive, and intelligent environment. Relevant electronic databases were searched, and 248 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis. Our review suggests that significant improvements are required in connectivity, data sensing, and collection to enhance both subtractive and additive technologies, though the pervasive use of AI by machines and software helps to automate processes. An intelligent system is highly recommended in both conventional and non-conventional subtractive manufacturing (SM) methods to monitor and inspect the workpiece conditions for defect detection and to control the machining strategies in response to instantaneous output. Similarly, AM product quality can be improved through the online monitoring of melt pool and defect formation using suitable sensing devices followed by process control using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Challenges in implementing intelligent additive and subtractive manufacturing systems are also discussed in the article. The challenges comprise difficulty in self-optimizing CNC systems considering real-time material property and tool condition, defect detections by in-situ AM process monitoring, issues of overfitting and underfitting data in ML models and expensive and complicated set-ups in hybrid manufacturing processes.},

The architecture of our U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net is a two-level nested U-structure. The design has the following advantages: (1) it is able to capture more contextual information from different scales thanks to the mixture of receptive fields of different sizes in our proposed ReSidual U-blocks (RSU), (2) it increases the depth of the whole architecture without significantly increasing the computational cost because of the pooling operations used in these RSU blocks. This architecture enables us to train a deep network from scratch without using backbones from image classification tasks. We instantiate two models of the proposed architecture, U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net (176.3 MB, 30 FPS on GTX 1080Ti GPU) and U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}dagger\}\$ (4.7 MB, 40 FPS), to facilitate the usage in different environments. Both models achieve competitive performance on six SOD datasets. The code is available: https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net.},

A primary aim is to comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of the Rosenthal equation (which provides an analytical alternative to FE analysis), and to investigate the influence of underlying assumptions on estimated results. Various physical characteristics are compared among the FE model, Rosenthal equation, and experiments. The predicted melt pool shapes compared with reported experimental results from the literature show that both the FE model and the analytical (Rosenthal) equation provide a reasonably accurate estimation. At high heat input, under conditions leading to keyholing, the reported melt width is narrower than predicted by the analytical equation. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis based on choices of the absorptivity is performed, which shows that the Rosenthal approach is more sensitive to absorptivity, compared with the FE approach. The primary reason could be the effect of radiative and convective losses, which are assumed to be negligible in the Rosenthal equation. In addition, both methods predict a columnar solidification microstructure, which agrees well with experimental reports, and the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) predicted with the two approaches is comparable with measurements.},

Since their emergence, they have garnered particular attention as a shift away from costly physical testing and towards the use of high fidelity simulations, sensor data and intelligent control. Metal additive manufacturing (AM), a 3D printing technology prone to defects, requires a digital twin capable of tackling issues of printed part qualification, certification and optimisation. In this paper, we evaluate the key features specific to metal AM and review the current literature of modelling, sensing, control and machine intelligence. We find that the body of research toward the development of an metal additive manufacturing (AM) digital twin can be organised logically into a hierarchy of four levels of increasing complexity. The elements composing each level require deep integration and we highlight the key enabling technologies: surrogate modelling, in-situ sensing, hardware control systems and intelligent control policies. Our proposed digital twin hierarchy for AM provides a developer framework for engineering digital twins, both for AM and other intelligent manufacturing systems.},

The microstructure was investigated after SLM, HIP and normalizing and tempering treatments. In all cases, it consisted of thin martensitic laths. Subsize tensile samples were extracted from the mock-ups to measure the mechanical tensile properties after each step of the manufacturing process.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16168},
	abstract = {Defects in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parts often result from the meso-scale dynamics of the molten alloy near the laser, known as the melt pool. For instance, the melt pool can directly contribute to the formation of undesirable porosity, residual stress, and surface roughness in the final part. Experimental in-situ monitoring of the three-dimensional melt pool physical fields is challenging, due to the short length and time scales involved in the process. Multi-physics simulation methods can describe the three-dimensional dynamics of the melt pool, but are computationally expensive at the mesh refinement required for accurate predictions of complex effects, such as the formation of keyhole porosity. Therefore, in this work, we develop a generative deep learning model based on the probabilistic diffusion framework to map low-fidelity, coarse-grained simulation information to the high-fidelity counterpart. By doing so, we bypass the computational expense of conducting multiple high-fidelity simulations for analysis by instead upscaling lightweight coarse mesh simulations. Specifically, we implement a 2-D diffusion model to spatially upscale cross-sections of the coarsely simulated melt pool to their high-fidelity equivalent. We demonstrate the preservation of key metrics of the melting process between the ground truth simulation data and the diffusion model output, such as the temperature field, the melt pool dimensions and the variability of the keyhole vapor cavity. Specifically, we predict the melt pool depth within 3 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ based on low-fidelity input data 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ coarser than the high-fidelity simulations, reducing analysis time by two orders of magnitude.},

In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, components are built by selectively melting specific areas of the powder bed, to form the two-dimensional cross-section of the specific part. However, the high occurrence of defects impacts the adoption of this method for precision applications. Therefore, a control policy for dynamically altering process parameters to avoid phenomena that lead to defect occurrences is necessary. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that derives a versatile control strategy for minimizing the likelihood of these defects is presented. The generated control policy alters the velocity of the laser during the melting process to ensure the consistency of the melt pool and reduce overheating in the generated product. The control policy is trained and validated on efficient simulations of the continuum temperature distribution of the powder bed layer under various laser trajectories.},

	abstract = {We introduce an experimental method to image melt pool temperature with a single commercial color camera and compare the results with multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. This approach leverages the principle of two-color (i.e., ratiometric) thermal imaging, which is advantageous because it negates the need for a priori knowledge of melt pool emissivity, plume transmissivity, and the camera’s view factor. The color camera’s ability to accurately measure temperature was validated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) blackbody source and tungsten filament lamp between temperatures of 1600 K and 2800 K. To demonstrate the technique, an off-axis high-speed color camera operating at 22 500 frames per second capturing a 2.8 mm × 2.8 mm area on the build plate was used to image both no-powder and powder single beads on a commercial laser powder bed fusion machine. Melt pool temperature fields for 316L stainless steel at varying processing conditions show peaks between 3300 K and 3700 K depending on the laser power and increased variability in the presence of powder. Measurements of nickel superalloy 718 and Ti-6Al-4V show comparable temperatures, with increased plume obstruction, especially in Ti-6Al-4V due to vaporization of aluminum. Multi-physics CFD models are used to simulate metal melt pools but some parameters such as the accommodation and Fresnel coefficients are not well characterized. Fitting a FLOW-3D® CFD model to ex-situ measurements of the melt pool cross-sectional geometry for 316L stainless steel identifies multiple combinations of Fresnel coefficient and accommodation coefficient that lead to geometric agreement. Only two of these combinations show agreement with the thermal images, motivating the need for thermal imaging as a means to advance validation of complex physics models. Our methodology can be applied to any color camera to better monitor and understand melt pools that yield high-quality parts.},

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

Equiaxed grains were observed more frequently in the region of high G rather than in the region of low G, contrary to the trend of the CET criterion. Computational thermal-fluid dynamics (CtFD) simulation has revealed that the fluid velocity is significantly higher in the case of smaller melt regions. The G on the solidification front of a small melt pool tends to be high, but at the same, the temperature gradient along the melt pool surface also tends to be high.

Although studies have shown relationships between process parameters and porosity, monitoring strategies for defect detection and pore formation are still needed. In this paper, instantaneous anomalous conditions are detected in-situ via pyrometry during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing and correlated with voids observed using post-build micro-computed tomography. Large two-color pyrometry data sets were used to estimate instantaneous temperatures, melt pool orientations and aspect ratios. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to processed pyrometry data to detect outlier images and conditions. It is shown that melt pool outliers are good predictors of voids observed post-build. With this approach, real time process monitoring can be incorporated into systems to detect defect and void formation. Alternatively, using the methodology presented here, pyrometry data can be post processed for porosity assessment.},

These video models are all built on Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with {\textasciitilde}20x less pre-training data and {\textasciitilde}3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2).

	abstract = {Variability and repeatability challenges in Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) limit its industrial applications. The difficulty of effectively evaluating similar defects with varying severity poses reliability issues for in-situ monitoring based on acoustic monitoring. In the LPBF acoustic monitoring scenario, the original signal amplitude is weak, and the acoustic field coupling information is complex, so it is difficult to directly obtain high-quality and physically reasonable LPBF defect features, which leads to the difficulty of reliably monitoring LPBF defects. This study proposes a novel LPBF pore defect monitoring approach based on acoustic signal physical defect information feature extraction and interpretable deep learning. Firstly, based on the established correlation mechanism among the molten pool, defects, and signals in the LPBF process, the effectiveness of acoustic feature representation in reflecting defect information is demonstrated. Secondly, the TFSST method is proposed to enhance the expression of the most relevant and physically reasonable time-frequency features of weak amplitude LPBF defect signals. Finally, the multi-scale spatially interactive fusion convolutional neural network (MSSIF-CNN) is proposed for in-situ monitoring of LPBF defects using an ABAE monitoring system. The proposed method can recognize five LPBF defects with an accuracy of 99.12 \%. In addition, the visualization results verify that the model possesses superior adaptive defect feature extraction capabilities and effectively focuses on the most relevant and physically reasonable defect characterization information. With millisecond monitoring response times and physically interpretable defect monitoring decision-making capabilities, the method offers the potential for industrialized in-situ monitoring.},

BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7\% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.},

	abstract = {Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has been extended to multilinguality, that is to handle more than one translation direction with a single system. Multilingual NMT showed competitive performance against pure bilingual systems. Notably, in low-resource settings, it proved to work effectively and efficiently, thanks to shared representation space that is forced across languages and induces a sort of transfer-learning. Furthermore, multilingual NMT enables so-called zero-shot inference across language pairs never seen at training time. Despite the increasing interest in this framework, an in-depth analysis of what a multilingual NMT model is capable of and what it is not is still missing. Motivated by this, our work (i) provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of the translations produced by bilingual, multilingual and zero-shot systems; (ii) investigates the translation quality of two of the currently dominant neural architectures in MT, which are the Recurrent and the Transformer ones; and (iii) quantitatively explores how the closeness between languages influences the zero-shot translation. Our analysis leverages multiple professional post-edits of automatic translations by several different systems and focuses both on automatic standard metrics (BLEU and TER) and on widely used error categories, which are lexical, morphology, and word order errors.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.

We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn interesting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple attention.},

To explore the mechanisms of porosity formation at atmospheric pressure and porosity defects mitigation under vacuum, the weld pool and fluid flow behaviors were directly observed by placing a transparent glass plate on one side of the weld pool. The results showed that the vacuum condition was favorable for reducing porosity, especially process porosity. It was also found that the weld pool size and fluid flow were totally different at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. At atmospheric pressure, bubbles were trapped in the vortex induced by two opposing fluid flows, failed to escape from the weld pool and finally formed pores. Under vacuum, suppression of vapor plume and reduction in the boiling point led to a deeper keyhole and a thinner weld pool, resulting in an upward flow in the rear weld pool. In this case, the bubbles could escape easily from the weld pool with the help of the upward flow.},

Furthermore, the non-adaptive nature of FEA requires the entire model to be solved even for minor geometric variations creating a bottleneck during iterative design optimization. This necessitates a framework that can efficiently predict stress distribution in geometries based on given boundary and loading conditions. In this paper, we present StressD, a framework for predicting von Mises stress fields based on the denoising diffusion model. The StressD framework involves two models, a U-net-based denoising diffusion model and an auxiliary network to generate and predict stress distribution in structures. The denoising diffusion model generates a normalized stress map based on the given geometry, boundary conditions and loading condition, while the auxiliary network is used to determine the scaling information needed to un-normalize the generated stress map. We evaluate the StressD framework on cantilever structures and show that it is able to accurately predict von Mises stress fields while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional FEA.},

	abstract = {The inherent complexity of the fluid flow in subsurface systems brings potential inevitable uncertainty in their characterization. Computationally intensive high-dimensional inversion problems often emerge in solving the fluid flow problems of various scenarios, which required to be probed. To improve the efficiency of solving such problems, surrogate strategies are widely used to quantify the uncertainty of underground multiphase flow models. In this paper, a deep learning surrogate model is developed for predicting the time-dependent dynamic multiphase flow in a two-dimensional (2D) channelized geological system. The surrogate model is combined with a residual U-net and an autoregressive strategy, which considers the output at the previous time step as input and predict the output at the current time step. The residual U-net has a symmetric network structure similar to U-net and contains extra residual units. The rich skip connections in the network can promote information dissemination and achieve better prediction performance with fewer parameters. We demonstrated the performance of the autoregressive residual U-net (AR-Runet) for predicting the migration of solute transport in heterogeneous 2D binary model. The result shows the AR-Runet surrogate model can provide an accurate approximation of saturation and pressure fields at different times. We also have demonstrated that with the autoregressive strategy this network can achieve similar predict results with relatively less training data. The performance of the AR-Runet network is also compared with the autoregressive Dense net (AR-Dense). The findings indicate that the AR-Runet can provide effective measures for developing surrogate model and uncertainty analysis in dynamic multiphase flow predictions of subsurface systems.},

	abstract = {Laser Powder-Bed Fusions (LPBF), a class of additive manufacturing (AM), is a promising technique for producing components with complex geometry design. However, parts fabricated by LPBF suffer from residual stresses arising due to substantial temperature gradients inherent to the process. Numerical models are unable to provide a comprehensive thermal history of the built materials efficiently due to the mismatch between the characteristic length scales and infinitesimal time steps needed for complete simulations. In the present work, an extended Rosenthal’s model is presented by considering the effects of various heat dissipation/consumption mechanisms. The modeling results of energy auditing of thermal boundary conditions for stainless steel (SS17-4PH) laser melting indicated that the total energy losses by convection, radiation, and melting are less than 20\% among which, radiation is the most dominant part. A comparison of the results obtained by the extended Rosenthal’s equation with finite element numerical predictions and experimental data shows a good agreement. Also, a parametric study has been conducted to identify the influence of laser scanning velocity, beam radius, and power on the overall temperature distributions and melt geometry. The present study can pave the way for the prospective use of this methodology to conduct further investigation such as microstructure analysis and thermo-mechanical modeling which are needed to predict residual stresses and distortions.},

In particular, we focussed on the influence of the powders used on the formation of porosities and cavities in the manufactured components. A detailed experimental campaign was carried out to characterize the components made through the two additive manufacturing techniques aforementioned and the powders used in the process. It was found that some defects of the final components can be attributed to internal porosities of the powders used in the manufacturing process. These internal porosities are a consequence of the gas atomization process used for the production of the powders themselves. Therefore, the importance of using tailored powders, free from porosities, in order to manufacture components with high mechanical properties is highlighted.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process, a specific part is built in an iterative manner in which two-dimensional cross-sections are formed on top of each other by selectively melting and fusing the desired areas of the powder bed. In this process, the temperature field and melt pool morphology play a major role in the quality of the manufactured part and its possible defects. Therefore, predicting these factors is of high importance. However, simulating such a complex phenomenon is usually very time-consuming and requires huge computational resources. In this work, we create three datasets consisting of single-trail L-PBF processes using the Flow-3D simulation software and use them to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting the three-dimensional temperature field solely by taking the process parameters and the time step as input. The CNN achieves a relative Root Mean Squared Error less of than 5\% for the temperature field in the solidifying region and an average Intersection over Union score of 80\% to 90\% in predicting the three-dimensional geometry of the melt pool. Moreover, since time is included as one of the inputs of the model, the temperature field can be obtained in a matter of a few seconds for any arbitrary time step without the need to iterate and compute all the steps.},

A major goal is to determine the merits and demerits of this analytical equation which can be an alternative to FE analysis, and to evaluate the effect of imperative assumptions on predicted consequences. Using results from the analytical and numerical approaches in conjunction with experiments, different physical features are compared. In this study, the results obtained from experiments in terms of melt pool shapes are compared with the predicted ones achieved from the numerical and analytical approaches in which the FE model is more accurate than the Rosenthal equation in the estimation of the melt pool dimensions. Furthermore, as to the partially melted zones, the estimations achieved from the numerical modeling are more genuine than ones from the analytical equation with regards to the experimental results. At high energy density, near keyhole welding mode, the reported results show that experimental melt widths are supposed to be narrower than the fusion widths estimated by the analytical solution. The primary explanation could be the influence of thermal losses that occurred during convection and radiation, which are neglected in the Rosenthal equation. Additionally, the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) estimated with the numerical modeling and the analytical Rosenthal solution is comparable with the experimental results obtained.},

To date, measuring DED distortions on complex geometries has only been achieved post process, discarding the complex thermomechanical history that leads to that final material state. In this work, surround stereo digital image correlation (DIC) is used to 3D map surfaces and strain tensors in-situ in a powder-blown laser DED system. Infrared thermography is then projected onto these surfaces to record the full thermomechanical history of printed parts. DIC presents a unique challenge to DED AM, as no part exists at the beginning of deposition, which (a) prevents application of an appropriate speckle pattern and (b) denies the user a zero strain reference frame. Solutions to these problems are proposed and their limitations explored herein. In sum, this work presents a relatively low-cost solution to monitoring and optimizing the unique temporal artifacts induced by complex scan strategies that was previously unobtainable.},

	abstract = {A Transformer-based deep direct sampling method is proposed for electrical impedance tomography, a well-known severely ill-posed nonlinear boundary value inverse problem. A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed images. An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. This research shall strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.},

Furthermore, part properties such as mechanical properties, surface roughness, or density exhibit a comparatively low reproducibility. Recent progress in the field of process monitoring, however, indicates that infrared thermography can be used to correlate melt pool temperatures with the resulting part properties. The analysis of the influence of process parameters on the resulting melt pool temperatures has up until now been limited to the evaluation of the maximum temperature during exposure and the mean temperature at arbitrary moments after exposure. However, the cooling rate of the polymer melt is also essential. To prove this hypothesis, a continuous data stream, which enables an automated calculation of characteristic processing times and temperatures, is introduced within the scope of this work. Single-layer specimens are manufactured with various energy inputs, while the resulting temperature of the melt is recorded using thermal imaging. The peak temperatures are combined with the characteristics that describe the temperature decay after exposure, such as a decay time determined at a specific cooling rate. These metrics quantify the cooling behavior of melt pools in a systematic and reproducible way. Furthermore, the sequence of decay values at different cooling rates can potentially be combined with existing process knowledge to differentiate process regimes. The presented approach can be used to create a more in-depth process understanding in later works, thereby enabling applications such as in-situ quality assurance.},

The most relevant metal AM applications currently involve industrial sectors (e.g. aerospace and bio-medical) where defects avoidance is fundamental. Because of this, there is the need to develop novel in situ monitoring tools able to keep under control the stability of the process on a layer-by-layer basis, and to detect the onset of defects as soon as possible. On the one hand, AM systems must be equipped with in situ sensing devices able to measure relevant quantities during the process, a.k.a. process signatures. On the other hand, in-process data analytics and statistical monitoring techniques are required to detect and localize the defects in an automated way. This paper reviews the literature and the commercial tools for in situ monitoring of powder bed fusion (PBF) processes. It explores the different categories of defects and their main causes, the most relevant process signatures and the in situ sensing approaches proposed so far. Particular attention is devoted to the development of automated defect detection rules and the study of process control strategies, which represent two critical fields for the development of future smart PBF systems.},

In the absence of theoretical underpinnings, controlled experiments aimed at explaining these strategies can aid our understanding of deep learning landscapes and the training dynamics. Existing approaches for empirical analysis rely on tools of linear interpolation and visualizations with dimensionality reduction, each with their limitations. Instead, we revisit such analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz., mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons for the success of the heuristics. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA. Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed to the deeper layers.},

Although the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is the most popular option when dealing with natural images, for biomedical image segmentation the soft Dice loss is often preferred due to its ability to handle imbalanced scenarios. On the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully applied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the generalization ability of all these losses in the presence of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time that are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case, we train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we also have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of different loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability to generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation from endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our findings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting in-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data, which leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of problems, due to its robustness and ability to generalize to OoD samples.

They were registered to the original CAD. Dataset for machine learning was assembled from those registered 3D models. The trained machine learning model can precisely predict local porosity caused by lack of fusion and keyhole with multi-layer monitoring images. It also indicates the optimal processing window. It is impossible to be sure about the occurrence of defects in a layer based only on the abnormality of a single layer, and vice versa. Defects in a layer can be caused by improper parameters or anomalies in current layer or subsequent layers; defects in one layer can also be eliminated by proper parameters in the following layers.

Many new methods have been proposed and defect detection capabilities have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, several challenges and open issues still need to be tackled to bridge the gap between methods proposed in the literature and actual industrial implementation. This paper presents an updated review of the literature on in-situ sensing, measurement and monitoring for metal PBF processes, with a classification of methods and a comparison of enabled performances. The study summarises the types and sizes of defects that are practically detectable while the part is being produced and the research areas where additional technological advances are currently needed.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to achieve the defect-free production of parts made using Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. As a step towards this goal, the objective is to detect flaws in AM parts during the process by combining predictions from a physical model (simulation) with in-situ sensor signatures in a machine learning framework. We hypothesize that flaws in AM parts are detected with significantly higher statistical fidelity (F-score) when both in-situ sensor data and theoretical predictions are pooled together in a machine learning model, compared to an approach that is based exclusively on machine learning of sensor data (black-box model) or physics-based predictions (white-box model). We test the hypothesized efficacy of such a gray-box model or digital twin approach in the context of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) AM processes. For example, in the DED process, we first predicted the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature in a thin-wall titanium alloy part using a computational heat transfer model based on graph theory. Subsequently, we combined the preceding physics-derived thermal trends with in-situ temperature measurements obtained from a pyrometer in a readily implemented supervised machine learning framework (support vector machine). We demonstrate that the integration of temperature predictions from an ab initio heat transfer model and in-situ sensor data is capable of detecting flaws in the DED-produced thin-wall part with F-score approaching 90\%. By contrast, the F-score decreases to nearly 80\% when either temperature measurements from the in-situ sensor or temperature distribution predictions from the theoretical model are used alone by themselves. This work thus demonstrates an early foray into the digital twin paradigm for real-time process monitoring in AM via seamless integration of physics-based modeling (simulation), in-situ sensing, and data analytics (machine learning).},

	abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED) is a metal additive manufacturing process, where dimensional accuracy and repeatability are traditionally challenging to achieve. Strategies for computationally inexpensive process modelling and fast-response process controls of the laser deposition process are necessary to keep the geometric features close to the required dimensional tolerances. The deposition geometry depends highly on the complex local laser-material interaction and global thermal history of the substrate. In order to control the deposition geometry, an accurate and computationally inexpensive discretized state space thermal history model coupled with an analytical deposition geometry model is developed in this work. The model accounts for the local laser-material interaction using the mass and energy equilibrium equations coupled in a lumped parameter solution, as well as the global thermal history of the product using a state space thermomechanical discretization. In literature, studies have only focused on 1D toolpaths with constant process parameters such as speed, powder feedrate, and laser power. As it is possible to achieve highly complex geometric shapes with additive manufacturing, it is important to have models compatible with 2D/3D complex toolpaths. In this paper, an analytical thermomechanical model and a coupled deposition geometry model for DED process are presented and experimentally validated. As such, the thermal history of the deposited part is predicted throughout the process and the geometric features are predicted for 2D toolpaths.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in learning task specific features that allow for unprecedented performance on various computer vision tasks. Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.},

The aim of this paper is to further the understanding of how to cope with the need to develop process understanding, while at the same time designing products that can be qualified. A qualitative action research study has been performed, using the development of an AM rocket engine turbine demonstrator as a case study. The results show that the qualification approach should be developed for the specific application, dependent on the AM knowledge within the organization. AM knowledge is not only linked to the AM process but to the complete AM process chain. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the manufacturing chain during design and to develop necessary knowledge concurrently with the product in order to define suitable requirements. The paper proposes a Design for Qualification framework, supported by six design tactics. The framework encourages proactive consideration for qualification and the capabilities of the AM process chain, as well as the continuous development of AM knowledge during product development.},

When process outcomes such as strength, density, or precision need to meet certain specifications, changes in process variable selection can be made to meet these requirements. However, the changes required to achieve a better part performance may not be intuitive, particularly because process variable changes can simultaneously improve some outcomes while worsening others. There is great potential to design the additive manufacturing process, tailoring process variables based on user requirements for a given part. In this work, the tradeoffs between multiple process outcomes are formalized and the design problem is explored throughout the design space of process variables. Based on user input for each process outcome considered, P–V (power–velocity) process design charts are introduced, which map the process space and identify the best combination of process variables to achieve a user's desired outcome.},

Limited by the implementation conditions, CT with incomplete projections happens quite often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms are not easy to deal with incomplete data. They are usually involved with complicated parameter selection operations, also sensitive to noise and time-consuming. In this paper, we reported a deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data CT. It is the tight coupling of the deep learning U-net and CT reconstruction algorithm in the domain of the projection sinograms. The U-net estimated results are not the artifacts caused by the incomplete data, but the complete projection sinograms. After training, this framework is determined and can reconstruct the final high quality CT image from a given incomplete projection sinogram. Taking the sparse-view and limited-angle CT as examples, this framework has been validated and demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data sets. Embedded with CT reconstruction, this framework naturally encapsulates the physical imaging model of CT systems and is easy to be extended to deal with other challenges. This work is helpful to push the application of the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in the field of CT.},

In the following steps the effect of shot peening on pore size and morphology in dependency of depth was examined. A strong porosity shrinkage could be achieved in near-surface areas (0–500 μm), but also in depths that did not seem accessible via shot peening, leading to an overall relative porosity reduction between 15–30\%. Furthermore, shot peening led to a pore sphericity increase, especially for large pores. The individual orientation of the pores were compared before and after shot peening, where the former mostly had their longest axis in surface normal direction, while the latter showed a more randomly orientation distribution. X-ray diffractography detected residual compressive stresses for the as-built as well as the shot peened samples. Finally fatigue tests were performed, indicating an increase in low- and high-cycle-fatigue resistance after shot peening by 20 MPa.},

	abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has tremendous potential for manufacturing geometrically complex metallic products with freedom of design and desirable performance. Qualification and certification are critical to ensuring the successful adoption of metal AM by various sectors and accelerating the standardisation progress. This article provides a comprehensive review on the status of standardisation and challenges for the qualification and certification of metal AM, which is a timely summary to bridge the readiness gap between metal AM technologies developed at academia and industry. It begins with introducing fundamentals of metal AM qualification and certification. Thereafter, the status of standards, rules, and regulations developed by international organisations and communities is summarised and discussed. The challenges are then addressed, including the qualification and certification process, materials, process reliability and repeatability, post-processing, data, and standards and protocols. Finally, the conclusion and future outlook are drawn to provide guidance for future research and development.},

	abstract = {Recognizing a target of interest from the UAVs is much more challenging than the existing object re-identification tasks across multiple city cameras. The images taken by the UAVs usually suffer from significant size difference when generating the object bounding boxes and uncertain rotation variations. Existing methods are usually designed for city cameras, incapable of handing the rotation issue in UAV scenarios. A straightforward solution is to perform the image-level rotation augmentation, but it would cause loss of useful information when inputting the powerful vision transformer as patches. This motivates us to simulate the rotation operation at the patch feature level, proposing a novel rotation invariant vision transformer (RotTrans). This strategy builds on high-level features with the help of the specificity of the vision transformer structure, which enhances the robustness against large rotation differences. In addition, we design invariance constraint to establish the relationship between the original feature and the rotated features, achieving stronger rotation invariance. Our proposed transformer tested on the latest UAV datasets greatly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, which is 5.9\% and 4.8\% higher than the highest mAP and Rank1. Notably, our model also performs competitively for the person re-identification task on traditional city cameras. In particular, our solution wins the first place in the UAV-based person re-recognition track in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition held in ICCV 2021.

	abstract = {Material Extrusion (ME) is becoming one of the most promising class of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes in the manufacturing panorama for its capability of realizing products with complex shapes, potentially in large dimensions, for a variety of applications and materials for different industrial sectors. Despite the significant advances in material range and machine capabilities, the lack of process stability and repeatability of ME still represents an obstacle for the adoption of this process on large industrial scales. Following the success of in-situ monitoring in other AM technologies, some studies are investigating the possibility of embedding in-situ sensors on commercial machines. Among them, thermal infrared monitoring systems have gained lots of interest for the crucial role of temperature evolution in final part quality and mechanical performance. This study presents a data-driven methodology for in-situ monitoring of thermal profiles. The proposed algorithm extracts, models, and compares the cooling history at different locations. By combining a tracking algorithm and automatic detection of region of interests and robust regression for functional data modeling, we propose a solution to study the cooling history of the 3D printed geometry as the process evolves, to draw general conclusions on the process and detect anomalous thermal profiles, which may entail lack of bonding or other flaws. This paper further proposes a novel approach to automatically detect local temperature inhomogeneities, also known as “hot” and “cold spots”, which are often symptomatic of critical defects in the 3D printed part. In-situ detection of hold- and cold-spots can be particularly useful for large scale products or functional products printing. The proposed methods can be applied to any ME process, but it is specifically applied to a real case study of Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show the effectiveness of all the proposed solutions and pave the way towards zero-defects production.},

If the magnitude of different transformations does not exceed a class- and transformation dependent threshold, both architectures show invariant behavior. In this work we furthermore introduce a new learnable module, the Invariant Transformer Net, which enables us to learn differentiable parameters for a set of affine transformations. This allows us to extract the space of transformations to which the CNN is invariant and its class prediction robust.},

Short layer build times do not provide enough time for the material to cool sufficiently. As a result, an object cannot support its own weight nor deal with overhanging features. Additionally, the generation of support structures may be impractical either due to geometry or, in the case of large-scale polymer additive manufacturing, due to being difficult to remove. To address these issues, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated the use of a thermal camera mounted to a gantry to collect data on an object under construction. This data provided feedback for an in-situ control system to adjust layer build times. Adjustments were made in the form of additional waiting to allow the material to cool to specific thermal thresholds. This additional cooling time allowed the construction of objects with low layer build times or overhanging features that would have otherwise failed.},

This paper presents a novel approach to quantify the distortions experimentally and to use the results in numerical simulation validation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is applied together with optical filters to measure in-situ distortions directly on a wall geometry produced with LMD. The wall shows cyclic expansion and shrinking with the edges bending inward and the top of the sample exhibiting a slight u‐shape as residual distortions. Subsequently, a structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the experiment is established, calibrated against experimental temperature profiles and used to predict the in-situ distortions of the sample. A comparison of the experimental and numerical results reveals a good agreement in length direction of the sample and quantitative deviations in height direction, which are attributed to the material model used. The suitability of the novel experimental approach for measurements on an AM sample is shown and the potential for the validated numerical model as a predictive tool to reduce trial-and-error and improve part quality is evaluated.},

We address these limitations with a method for data augmentation, based on the introduction of random elastic deformations on images of mammograms. We validate this method on three publicly available datasets. Our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is trained for mass classification - in a conventional way -, and then used in the more interesting problem of mass detection in full mammograms by transforming the CNN into a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).},

To address defects during object construction, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100\% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50\% overfill. Within two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10\% of the expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system can compensate for uneven build surfaces.},

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

	abstract = {Lack-of-fusion flaws can occur in powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing of metal components. This paper demonstrates a method for detecting such flaws by monitoring the fabrication of every layer before and after laser scanning with high resolution optical imaging. A binary template is created from the sliced 3D model of the part. Using this template the optical image data is indexed to the part geometry. The indexed image data is used to detect anomalies in the powder layer before laser scanning and in the solidified material after scanning. Lack-of-fusion defects are identified from optical data by correlating multiple images with different lighting conditions and from multiple layers. To test the algorithms intentional defects are created inside a test part at different locations and are successfully detected with a high true positive rate.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) as a highly digitalized manufacturing technology is capable of the implementation of the concept of the digital twin (DT), which promises highly automated and optimized part production. Since the DT is a quite novel concept requiring a wide framework of various technologies, it is not state of the art yet, though. Especially the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) methods is still challenging. Applying the methodology of the systematic review, the state of the art regarding the DT in AM with emphasis of required technologies and current challenges is assessed. Furthermore, the topic of AI is investigated focusing the main applications in AM as well as the possibility to integrate today’s approaches into a DT environment.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is making dense and defect-free components. These porosity defects are dependent upon the melt pool geometry and the processing conditions. Power-velocity (PV) processing maps can aid in visualizing the effects of LPBF processing variables and mapping different defect regimes such as lack-of-fusion, under-melting, balling, and keyholing. This work presents an assessment of existing analytical equations and models that provide an estimate of the melt pool geometry as a function of material properties. The melt pool equations are then combined with defect criteria to provide a quick approximation of the PV processing maps for a variety of materials. Finally, the predictions of these processing maps are compared with experimental data from the literature. The predictive processing maps can be computed quickly and can be coupled with dimensionless numbers and high-throughput (HT) experiments for validation. The present work provides a boundary framework for designing the optimal processing parameters for new metals and alloys based on existing analytical solutions.},
