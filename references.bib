	abstract = {Typically, the development of materials is intimately tied to the concurrent development of manufacturing technologies especially suitable to that material. In the case of metal additive manufacturing (AM), in contrast, the alloys typically used a feedstock were originally developed having other traditional manufacturing technologies in mind. Since metal AM processes involve fundamentally different physics, it is common to encounter many challenges when processing these materials such as high susceptibility to defects and microstructure inconsistencies. Recent research directions call for developing new materials and alloys specifically for AM. This poses a new and significant challenge: how can we determine the optimal processing recipes for an alloy not previously investigated. This is a typically time-consuming and expensive endeavor and, in this work, we propose an efficient framework to efficiently and effectively determine the processing parameter window of a given alloy considered as potential feedstock for AM. The framework integrates design of experiments, physics-based simulation, uncertainty analysis and fabrication and characterization in order to determine the bounding region in the manufacturing space resulting in near full density, defect-free parts. The proposed framework is developed aiming at maximizing its efficiency, accessibility and practicality. We validate the proposed framework and demonstrate its robustness using three model materials, two of which have not been previously reported.},

	abstract = {Parser-based log compressors have been widely explored in recent years because the explosive growth of log volumes makes the compression performance of general-purpose compressors unsatisfactory. These parser-based compressors preprocess logs by grouping the logs based on the parsing result and then feed the preprocessed files into a general-purpose compressor. However, parser-based compressors have their limitations. First, the goals of parsing and compression are misaligned, so the inherent characteristics of logs were not fully utilized. In addition, the performance of parser-based compressors depends on the sample logs and thus it is very unstable. Moreover, parser-based compressors often incur a long processing time. To address these limitations, we propose Denum, a simple, general log compressor with high compression ratio and speed. The core insight is that a majority of the tokens in logs are numeric tokens (i.e. pure numbers, tokens with only numbers and special characters, and numeric variables) and effective compression of them is critical for log compression. Specifically, Denum contains a Numeric Token Parsing module, which extracts all numeric tokens and applies tailored processing methods (e.g. store the differences of incremental numbers like timestamps), and a String Processing module, which processes the remaining log content without numbers. The processed files of the two modules are then fed as input to a general-purpose compressor and it outputs the final compression results. Denum has been evaluated on 16 log datasets and it achieves an 8.7\%-434.7\% higher average compression ratio and 2.6x-37.7x faster average compression speed (i.e. 26.2MB/S) compared to the baselines. Moreover, integrating Denum's Numeric Token Parsing into existing log compressors can provide an 11.8\% improvement in their average compression ratio and achieve 37\% faster average compression speed.},

The necessary material constants, including absorptivity for laser-based melting, have been collated for alloy steels, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a layer-by-layer material deposition process that allows for more manufacturing flexibility and design complexity than traditional manufacturing processes. However, the print quality in metal AM is hard to be predicted and controlled due to its high process variability. Numerous process parameters are correlated/intertwined and have a direct/indirect relationship with the final build quality. However, these interconnections among the process parameters and print qualities are not yet fully understood and identified. To achieve a functional part without additional post-processing to improve the surface finish/mechanical properties, the comprehensive process model, which includes the semantic and qualitative connections among the process inputs-signatures-qualities, is urgently needed. Currently, surrogate models (regression models/ physical-based models) are widely used for predicting part qualities, specifically thermal distortion. These surrogate models can provide a simulated result based on the user-defined parameter settings. However, the reverse determination of the highly correlated parameters that can manage the print qualities in the desired standard cannot be achieved through these surrogate models. Understanding this interconnectivity is the top priority in building process models that will help to make the process more predictable and controllable. An ontology-based process map that captures the complicated metal AM processes, including all input parameters, physical, thermal model, and resultant build qualities (microstructure and mechanical properties), is provided in this manuscript. The connections among these factors are used to diagnose the relevant process variables regarding the specific build qualities, which can further combine with experimental data to contribute to a “printable” zone. The ontology-based process map links variable selection to quality requirements, creating a printable zone. A printable zone indicates the allowable process parameter selections, contributing to the desired part quality. Ultimately, the selected variable process data from the ontological process map will scope the parametrical analysis. The implementations of the ontology-based process map and printable zone are presented to demonstrate this proposed method's effectiveness by demonstrating that the proposed printable zone's validity and desired build quality can be achieved.},

In this work, we introduce PeptideGPT, a protein language model tailored to generate protein sequences with distinct properties: hemolytic activity, solubility, and non-fouling characteristics. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of these generated sequences, we established a comprehensive evaluation pipeline consisting of ideas from bioinformatics to retain valid proteins with ordered structures. First, we rank the generated sequences based on their perplexity scores, then we filter out those lying outside the permissible convex hull of proteins. Finally, we predict the structure using ESMFold and select the proteins with pLDDT values greater than 70 to ensure ordered structure. The properties of generated sequences are evaluated using task-specific classifiers - PeptideBERT and HAPPENN. We achieved an accuracy of 76.26\% in hemolytic, 72.46\% in non-hemolytic, 78.84\% in non-fouling, and 68.06\% in solubility protein generation.

Prevailing methods, notably graph neural networks (GNNs), demand precise atomic coordinates for constructing graph representations, while the integration of observable attributes remains challenging. This research introduces CatBERTa, an energy prediction Transformer model that uses textual inputs. Built on a Transformer encoder pretrained for language modeling purposes, CatBERTa processes human-interpretable text, incorporating target features. Attention score analysis reveals CatBERTa’s focus on tokens related to adsorbates, bulk composition, and their interacting atoms. Moreover, interacting atoms emerge as effective descriptors for adsorption configurations, while factors such as the bond length and atomic properties of these atoms offer limited predictive contributions. In predicting the adsorption energy from textual representations of initial structures, CatBERTa exhibits a precision comparable to that of conventional GNNs. Notably, in subsets recognized for their high accuracy with GNNs, CatBERTa consistently achieves a mean absolute error of 0.35 eV. Furthermore, the subtraction of the CatBERTa-predicted energies effectively cancels out their systematic errors by as much as 19.3\% for chemically similar systems, surpassing the error reduction observed in GNNs. This outcome highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of the energy difference predictions. This research establishes a fundamental framework for text-based catalyst property prediction without relying on graph representations while also unveiling intricate feature–property relationships.},

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.

However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7\% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35\% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7\% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7\% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.},

By contrast, transformer-based language models can directly use human-readable text inputs, potentially bypassing the need for detailed atomic positions or topology; however, these language models often struggle with accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations. Our study improves the predictive language model by aligning its latent space with well-established graph neural networks through a self-supervised process called graph-assisted pretraining. This method reduces the mean absolute error of energy prediction for adsorption configurations by 7.4–9.8\%, redirecting the model’s attention towards adsorption configuration. Building on this, we propose using generative large language models to create text inputs for the predictive model without relying on exact atomic positions. This demonstrates a potential use case of language models in energy prediction without detailed geometric information.},

	abstract = {Powder bed fusion-laser beam (PBF-LB) parts experience a significant decline in fatigue performance when process-induced defects are present. In this work, a decline in 4-point bend fatigue life was observed in PBF-LB Ti–6Al–4V coupons fabricated at constant power with increasing scanning velocity and which underwent subsequent stress relief and surface machining. Specifically, the presence of pores that resemble lack-of-fusion (LoF) and a decline in fatigue life were observed at scanning velocities lower than that expected from prior published work. It was hypothesized that this unexpected presence of LoF pores resulted from melt pool geometry variability that was not considered in prior work when the LoF criterion was implemented. Further, these pores can be small in size and infrequent in their occurrence when the melt pool geometry variability is not severe. Such sparse pores are challenging to characterize using conventional 2D characterization methods. This work leverages tall and narrow coupon geometry and high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (X-μCT) to capture LoF porosity. The results show that a modified melt pool overlap-based LoF criterion considering melt pool geometry variability captures the unexpected occurrence of LoF pores observed in X-μCT. In addition, the LoF percent metric displays a strongly negative correlation with fatigue performance. The insights from this work provide guidance on characterizing melt pool geometry variability across scan lines to systematically evaluate processing parameters that generate LoF pores, which, in turn, could lower fatigue performance.},

	abstract = {A multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate involving Gaussian processes (GPs) is used for designing temporal process maps in laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing (AM). Process maps are used to establish relationships between the melt pool properties (e.g., melt pool depth) and process parameters (e.g., laser power and scan velocity). The MFGP surrogate involves a high-fidelity (HF) and a low-fidelity (LF) model. The Autodesk Netfabb® finite element model (FEM) is selected as the HF model, while an analytical model developed by Eagar-Tsai is chosen as the LF one. The results show that the MFGP surrogate is capable of successfully blending the information present in different fidelity models for designing the temporal forward process maps (e.g., given a set of process parameters for which the true depth is not known, what would be the melt pool depth?). To expand the newly-developed formulation for establishing the temporal inverse process maps (e.g., to achieve the desired melt pool depth for which the true process parameters are not known, what would be the optimal prediction of the process parameters as a function of time?), a case study is performed by coupling the MFGP surrogate with Bayesian Optimization (BO) under computational budget constraints. The results demonstrate that MFGP-BO can significantly improve the optimization solution quality compared to the single-fidelity (SF) GP-BO, along with incurring a lower computational budget. As opposed to the existing methods that are limited to developing steady-state forward process maps, the current work successfully demonstrates the realization of temporal forward and inverse process maps in L-DED incorporating uncertainty quantification (UQ).},

Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.},

The transition to the balling mode is commonly identified through a series of trial-and-error experiments, an extremely inefficient approach. Here, we propose an outstandingly simple thermal scaling model for predicting the threshold from balling mode to conduction mode in laser powder bed fusion. The resulting balling criterion can be expressed as a dimensionless number which combines the material properties, the powder size and the pre-heating of the substrate. The model predictions are well in agreement with our validation experiments for three different materials (copper, bronze and steel). The applicability of the model assumptions is verified through a set of suitably designed multiphysics computational fluid dynamics simulations. The combination of first-hand experiments and simulations substantiates the balling model as a readily usable and reliable scaling criterion for establishing the minimum required power for laser powder bed fusion, applicable to different materials, as well as suggesting viable strategies to adjust the operating parameters towards the defect-free regime.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.},

	abstract = {Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90\%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.},

However, some keyhole porosity formation mechanisms, e.g., keyhole fluctuation, collapse and bubble growth and shrinkage, remain unclear. Using synchrotron X-ray imaging we reveal keyhole and bubble behaviour, quantifying their formation dynamics. The findings support the hypotheses that: (i) keyhole porosity can initiate not only in unstable, but also in the transition keyhole regimes created by high laser power-velocity conditions, causing fast radial keyhole fluctuations (2.5–10 kHz); (ii) transition regime collapse tends to occur part way up the rear-wall; and (iii) immediately after keyhole collapse, bubbles undergo rapid growth due to pressure equilibration, then shrink due to metal-vapour condensation. Concurrent with condensation, hydrogen diffusion into the bubble slows the shrinkage and stabilises the bubble size. The keyhole fluctuation and bubble evolution mechanisms revealed here may guide the development of control systems for minimising porosity.},

It shows that scanning the initial tracks onto a cold powder bed gives rise to the first line scan balling, due to the high thermal gradients imposed on the melt. Using a higher scan speed leads to the ‘shrinkage-induced balling’, because of a significant capillary instability effect. The ‘self-balling’ prevails at a high laser power combined with a low scan speed, which is ascribed to an excessive liquid formation and a too long liquid lifetime.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of defects has great potential for immediate impact in the production of fully-dense and defect free metal additive manufacturing (AM) builds. Accordingly, this paper presents Defect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) as a means of quantifying the role of porosity as an exemplary defect structure in powder bed printed materials. Synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (μSXCT) was used to demonstrate that metal AM defects follow predictable trends within processing parameter space for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) materials. Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks were fabricated on an EOS M290 utilizing variations in laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing. In general, characteristic under-melting or lack-of-fusion defects were discovered in the low laser power, high scan velocity region of process space via μSXCT. These defects were associated with insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and can be avoided through the application of a lack-of-fusion criterion using melt pool geometric modeling. Large-scale keyhole defects were also successfully mitigated for estimated melt pool morphologies associated with shallow keyhole front wall angles. Process variable selections resulting in deep keyholes, i.e., high laser power and low scan velocity, exhibit a substantial increase of spherical porosity as compared to the nominal (manufacturer recommended) processing parameters for Ti-6Al-4 V. Defects within fully-dense process space were also discovered, and are associated with gas porosity transfer to the AM test blocks during the laser-powder interaction. Overall, this work points to the fact that large-scale defects in LPBF materials can be successfully predicted and thus mitigated/minimized via appropriate selection of processing parameters.},

In this work, we introduce xVal, a strategy for continuously tokenizing numbers within language models that results in a more appropriate inductive bias for scientific applications.

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Enhancing a smaller model with specialized domain knowledge may provide an advantage over large language models which cannot be retrained quickly enough to keep up with the rapid pace of research in metal additive manufacturing (AM). We introduce "AMGPT," a specialized LLM text generator designed for metal AM queries. The goal of AMGPT is to assist researchers and users in navigating the extensive corpus of literature in AM. Instead of training from scratch, we employ a pre-trained Llama2-7B model from Hugging Face in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, utilizing it to dynamically incorporate information from \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 AM papers and textbooks in PDF format. Mathpix is used to convert these PDF documents into TeX format, facilitating their integration into the RAG pipeline managed by LlamaIndex. Expert evaluations of this project highlight that specific embeddings from the RAG setup accelerate response times and maintain coherence in the generated text.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	abstract = {As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into complex real-world environments, there is a growing need for approaches that enable robots to understand and act upon natural language instructions without relying on extensive pre-programmed knowledge of their surroundings. This paper presents PLATO, an innovative system that addresses this challenge by leveraging specialized large language model agents to process natural language inputs, understand the environment, predict tool affordances, and generate executable actions for robotic systems. Unlike traditional systems that depend on hard-coded environmental information, PLATO employs a modular architecture of specialized agents to operate without any initial knowledge of the environment. These agents identify objects and their locations within the scene, generate a comprehensive high-level plan, translate this plan into a series of low-level actions, and verify the completion of each step. The system is particularly tested on challenging tool-use tasks, which involve handling diverse objects and require long-horizon planning. PLATO's design allows it to adapt to dynamic and unstructured settings, significantly enhancing its flexibility and robustness. By evaluating the system across various complex scenarios, we demonstrate its capability to tackle a diverse range of tasks and offer a novel solution to integrate LLMs with robotic platforms, advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous robotic task execution.

A text based description of 326000 molecules were collected using ChatGPT and used to train LLM to learn the representation of molecules.

Experiments show that GPT-MolBERTa performs well on various molecule property benchmarks, and approaching state of the art performance in regression tasks.

The conventional SLM process is carried out in an inert gas filled chamber, at slightly greater pressure than ambient, to avoid oxidation at high temperature. However, the inert gas may cause pores in as-fabricated parts. In this study, the SLM process was carried out under vacuum in order to improve the quality of the SLM-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples. The as-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples then were subjected to hot-isostatic pressure (HIP). The remaining porosity was evaluated using X-ray computed tomography (CT). The microstructures and mechanical properties of the samples were evaluated with and without HIP. The test results showed that SLM under vacuum could reduce the porosity of Ti6Al4V samples, compared to material that was produced using the conventional SLM process. After HIP, porosity could be further reduced and the Ti6Al4V samples could achieve better elongation.},

	abstract = {With the development of Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing will be widely used to produce customized components. However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to produce components with sound structure and good mechanical properties using additive manufacturing by a trial-and-error approach. To obtain optimal process conditions, numerous experiments are needed to optimize the process variables within given machines and processes. Digital twins (DT) are defined as a digital representation of a production system or service or just an active unique product characterized by certain properties or conditions. They are the potential solution to assist in overcoming many issues in additive manufacturing, in order to improve part quality and shorten the time to qualify products. The DT system could be very helpful to understand, analyze and improve the product, service system or production. However, the development of genuine DT is still impeded due to lots of factors, such as the lack of a thorough understanding of the DT concept, framework, and development methods. Moreover, the linkage between existing brownfield systems and their data are under development. This paper aims to summarize the current status and issues in DT for additive manufacturing, in order to provide more references for subsequent research on DT systems.},

The influences of hatch spacing (H) on the thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and resultant surface quality of molten pool have been discussed in detail. The results revealed that the H had a significant influence on determining the terminally solidified surface quality of the SLM-processed components. As a relatively lower H of 40μm was used, a considerable amount of molten liquid migrated towards the previous as-fabricated tracks with a higher velocity, resulting in a stacking of molten liquid and the attendant formation of a poor surface quality with a large average surface roughness of 12.72μm. As an appropriate H of 60μm was settled, a reasonable temperature gradient and the resultant surface tension tended to spread the molten liquid with a steady velocity, favoring the formation of a flat surface of the component and an attendant low average surface roughness of 2.23μm. Both the surface morphologies and average surface roughness were experimentally obtained, which were in a full accordance with the results calculated by simulation.},

	abstract = {Driven by improved architectures and better representation learning frameworks, the field of visual recognition has enjoyed rapid modernization and performance boost in the early 2020s. For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt, have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9\% accuracy using only public training data.},

Critical quality issues such as porosity, surface roughness, crack, and delamination continue to present challenges within SLM-manufactured parts. Monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis are the key to improving the final part quality. Currently, it greatly hinders the adaptability and the development within the defect detection system since the setup restricts the vision and photo diode applications in the SLM process monitoring. Additionally, defect detection with traditional classification approaches makes the system rather complex due to introducing a series of steps. To meet these needs, this study proposes a novel method for the defect detection within the SLM parts. The setup was flexibly conducted using a microphone, and the defect detection was obtained by the framework of deep belief network (DBN). It is implemented by a simplified classification structure without signal preprocessing and feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the utilization of acoustic signals was workable for quality monitoring, and the DBN approach could reach high defect detection rate among five melted states without signal preprocessing.},

Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with the keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of the keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model incorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect, and Darcy’s law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results are validated with the in situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the instant bubble pinning on the solidification front. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. Additionally, the simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.},

	abstract = {Cobalt chromium is widely used to make medical implants and wind turbine, engine and aircraft components because of its high wear and corrosion resistance. The ability to process geometrically complex components is an area of intense interest to enable shifting from traditional manufacturing techniques to additive manufacturing (AM). The major reason for using AM is to ease design modification and optimization since AM machines can directly apply the changes from an updated STL file to print a geometrically complex object. Quality assurance for AM fabricated parts is recognized as a critical limitation of AM processes. In selective laser melting (SLM), layer by layer melting and remelting can lead to porosity defects caused by lack of fusion, balling, and keyhole collapse. Machine process parameter optimization becomes a very important task and is usually accomplished by producing a large amount of experimental coupons with different combinations of process parameters such as laser power, speed, hatch spacing, and powder layer thickness. In order to save the cost and time of these experimental trial and error methods, many researchers have attempted to simulate defect formation in SLM. Many physics-based assumptions must be made to model these processes, and thus, all the models are limited in some aspects. In the present work, we investigated single bead melt pool shapes for SLM of CoCr to tune the physics assumptions and then, applied to the model to predict bulk lack of fusion porosity within the finished parts. The simulation results were compared and validated against experimental results and show a high degree of correlation.},

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, traditional Fourier decomposition, and statistical measures of the time-series and corresponding frequency spectra were used to extract feature vectors which correlate to keyhole pore formation. Sequential feature selection revealed that measures associated with the acoustic spectra were most useful for identifying pore formations in L-PBF. A subset of the most informative data features was used to train a support vector machine model to predict pore formation with up to 97\% accuracy.},

Powder bed fusion (PBF) is one of the most common AM techniques. It sequentially processes a powdered feedstock in thin layers and solidifies it by either a laser beam or an electron beam. However, PBF induces microstructural defects that can adversely affect the performance of the manufactured components. These undesirable defects including voids and porosities must be avoided or minimized to limit their negative effects on mechanical properties and to ensure the consistency and repeatability of AM parts. The present article provides an overview of the formation mechanisms of pores in AM metals and some emerging techniques for the detection and quantification of pores. The review also highlights other common defects in PBF parts such as microstructural features associated with keyhole mode of melting.},

	abstract = {With the advance of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, complex designs can be created with engineering metals. One specific advantage of this greater design space is the ability to create small internal channels and passageways for cooling high heat flux or temperature applications such as electronics and gas turbine airfoils. These applications can have complex shapes, which when coupled with the required small channel sizes, make traditional finishing processes a challenge for additively manufactured parts. Therefore, it is desirable for designers to be able to use AM parts with small internal channels that are as-built. To achieve this goal, however, designers must know how the AM process affects internal channel tolerances and roughness levels, since both impact the amount of cooling that can be achieved in actual applications. In this study, the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process, more generically referred to as selective laser melting (SLM), was used to additively manufacture test coupons. The AM build direction was varied to study its effect on small microsized, circular channels. Specifically, X-ray computed tomography (CT-scan) was used to nondestructively inspect the interior of the test coupons. Using the data from the CT-scans, internal surface roughness, geometric tolerances, and deviations from the computer-aided design (CAD) model were calculated. In comparing the data, significant differences were seen between the three different build directions.},

These issues can be alleviated by our proposed NormFormer architecture, which adds three normalization operations to each layer: a Layer Norm after self attention, head-wise scaling of self-attention outputs, and a Layer Norm after the first fully connected layer. The extra operations incur negligible compute cost (+0.4\% parameter increase), but improve pretraining perplexity and downstream task performance for both causal and masked language models ranging from 125 Million to 2.7 Billion parameters. For example, adding NormFormer on top of our strongest 1.3B parameter baseline can reach equal perplexity 24\% faster, or converge 0.27 perplexity better in the same compute budget. This model reaches GPT3-Large (1.3B) zero shot performance 60\% faster. For masked language modeling, NormFormer improves fine-tuned GLUE performance by 1.9\% on average.

While some standards and specifications for documenting the various aspects of AM processes and materials exist and continue to evolve, many such standards still need to be matured or are under consideration/development within standards development organizations. An important subset of this evolving the standardization domain has to do with critical property measurements for AM materials. While such measurement procedures are well documented, with various legacy standards for conventional metallic material forms such as cast or wrought structural alloys, many fewer standards are currently available to enable systematic evaluation of those properties in AM-processed metallic materials. This is due in part to the current lack of AM-specific standards and specifications for AM materials and processes, which are a logical precursor to the material characterization standards for any material system. This paper summarizes some of the important standardization activities, as well as limitations associated with using currently available standards for metal AM with a focus on measuring mission-critical properties. Technical considerations in support of future standards development, as well as a pathway for qualification/certification of AM parts enabled by the appropriate standardization landscape, are discussed.},

Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood.
The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift".
In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm.
Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother.
This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

Changes in a part’s porosity during an additive manufacturing build may also be an indication of an undesired change in the build process. Here, we present efforts to develop an ultrasonic sensor for monitoring changes in the porosity in metal parts during fabrication on a metal powder bed fusion system. The development of well-characterized reference samples, measurements of the porosity of these samples with multiple techniques, and correlation of ultrasonic measurements with the degree of porosity are presented.

	abstract = {Porosity is an inherent attribute in selective laser melting (SLM) and profoundly degrades the build part quality and its performance. This study attempts to understand and characterize the keyhole pores formed during single-track scanning in SLM. First, 24 single tracks were generated using different line energy density (LED) levels, ranging from 0.1 J/mm to 0.98 J/mm, by varying the laser power and the scanning speed. The samples were then scanned by micro-computed tomography to measure keyhole pores and analyze the pore characteristics. The results show a general trend that the severity of the keyhole porosity increases with the increase of the LED with exceptions of certain patterns, implying important individual contributions from the parameters. Next, by keeping the LED constant in another set of experiments, different combinations of the power and the speed were tested to investigate the individual effect. Based on the results obtained, the laser power appears to have a greater effect than the scanning speed on both the pore number and the pore volume as well as the pore depth. For the same LED, the pore number and volume increase with increasing laser power until a certain critical level, beyond which, both the pore number and volume will decrease, if the power is further increased. For the LED of 0.32 J/mm, 0.4 J/mm, and 0.48 J/mm, the critical laser power that reverses the trend is about 132 W, 140 W, and 144 W, respectively.},

AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM.

These properties allow the dense vision transformer to provide finer-grained and more globally coherent predictions when compared to fully-convolutional networks. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements on dense prediction tasks, especially when a large amount of training data is available. For monocular depth estimation, we observe an improvement of up to 28\% in relative performance when compared to a state-of-the-art fully-convolutional network. When applied to semantic segmentation, dense vision transformers set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02\% mIoU.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has several possible advantages over traditional manufacturing including increased design freedom, reduced material usage, and shorter lead-times. A noteworthy capability of AM is the ability to monitor the process during material deposition and interrupt the process during fabrication if necessary. Recently, such monitoring, feedback, and control have been made possible by implementing in situ infrared (IR) thermography in powder bed fusion AM technologies. The purpose of the current research was to investigate the acquisition of absolute surface temperatures using in situ IR imaging of the melted or solid surfaces layer-by-layer during fabrication within an electron beam melting (EBM) system. The thermal camera was synchronized with the system's signal voltages of three synchronized events (pre-heating, melting, and raking) to automatically capture images. To acquire absolute temperature values from the IR images, a calibration procedure was established to determine the solid material's emissivity and reflected temperature or mean radiant temperature of the build chamber, which are necessary input parameters for the IR camera. A blackbody radiator was fabricated via EBM and was used as a tool to determine the emissivity of Ti–6Al–4V (determined to be 0.26 in the temperature range of the current study). Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to determine the view factors associated with the system's interior (e.g. heat shielding) that were used in calculating the mean radiant temperature of the manufacturing environment (∼342°C). Experimental validation of the model was performed using a thermocouple embedded during fabrication that showed a 3.77\% difference in temperature. A temperature difference of ∼366°C (1038°C vs. 672°C) was observed when comparing uncorrected IR temperature data with corrected temperature data. Upon validation of the IR parameters for a melted area, experimentation was conducted to also determine powder emissivity (found to be 0.50). The thermal model presented here can be modified and implemented in other AM technologies for consideration of radiation energy to acquire absolute temperatures of layered surfaces, leading to improved thermal monitoring and control of the fabrication process.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), an enabler of Industry 4.0, recently opened limitless possibilities in various sectors covering personal, industrial, medical, aviation and even extra-terrestrial applications. Although significant research thrust is prevalent on this topic, a detailed review covering the impact, status, and prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector has been ignored in the literature. Therefore, this review provides comprehensive information on smart mechanisms and systems emphasizing additive, subtractive and/or hybrid manufacturing processes in a collaborative, predictive, decisive, and intelligent environment. Relevant electronic databases were searched, and 248 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis. Our review suggests that significant improvements are required in connectivity, data sensing, and collection to enhance both subtractive and additive technologies, though the pervasive use of AI by machines and software helps to automate processes. An intelligent system is highly recommended in both conventional and non-conventional subtractive manufacturing (SM) methods to monitor and inspect the workpiece conditions for defect detection and to control the machining strategies in response to instantaneous output. Similarly, AM product quality can be improved through the online monitoring of melt pool and defect formation using suitable sensing devices followed by process control using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Challenges in implementing intelligent additive and subtractive manufacturing systems are also discussed in the article. The challenges comprise difficulty in self-optimizing CNC systems considering real-time material property and tool condition, defect detections by in-situ AM process monitoring, issues of overfitting and underfitting data in ML models and expensive and complicated set-ups in hybrid manufacturing processes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we design a simple yet powerful deep network architecture, U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net, for salient object detection (SOD). The architecture of our U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net is a two-level nested U-structure. The design has the following advantages: (1) it is able to capture more contextual information from different scales thanks to the mixture of receptive fields of different sizes in our proposed ReSidual U-blocks (RSU), (2) it increases the depth of the whole architecture without significantly increasing the computational cost because of the pooling operations used in these RSU blocks. This architecture enables us to train a deep network from scratch without using backbones from image classification tasks. We instantiate two models of the proposed architecture, U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net (176.3 MB, 30 FPS on GTX 1080Ti GPU) and U\${\textasciicircum}2\$-Net\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}dagger\}\$ (4.7 MB, 40 FPS), to facilitate the usage in different environments. Both models achieve competitive performance on six SOD datasets. The code is available: https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net.},

	abstract = {The finite-element (FE) model and the Rosenthal equation are used to study the thermal and microstructural phenomena in the laser powder-bed fusion of Inconel 718. A primary aim is to comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of the Rosenthal equation (which provides an analytical alternative to FE analysis), and to investigate the influence of underlying assumptions on estimated results. Various physical characteristics are compared among the FE model, Rosenthal equation, and experiments. The predicted melt pool shapes compared with reported experimental results from the literature show that both the FE model and the analytical (Rosenthal) equation provide a reasonably accurate estimation. At high heat input, under conditions leading to keyholing, the reported melt width is narrower than predicted by the analytical equation. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis based on choices of the absorptivity is performed, which shows that the Rosenthal approach is more sensitive to absorptivity, compared with the FE approach. The primary reason could be the effect of radiative and convective losses, which are assumed to be negligible in the Rosenthal equation. In addition, both methods predict a columnar solidification microstructure, which agrees well with experimental reports, and the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) predicted with the two approaches is comparable with measurements.},

	abstract = {Digital twins present a conceptual framework for product life-cycle monitoring and control using a simulated replica of the physical system. Since their emergence, they have garnered particular attention as a shift away from costly physical testing and towards the use of high fidelity simulations, sensor data and intelligent control. Metal additive manufacturing (AM), a 3D printing technology prone to defects, requires a digital twin capable of tackling issues of printed part qualification, certification and optimisation. In this paper, we evaluate the key features specific to metal AM and review the current literature of modelling, sensing, control and machine intelligence. We find that the body of research toward the development of an metal additive manufacturing (AM) digital twin can be organised logically into a hierarchy of four levels of increasing complexity. The elements composing each level require deep integration and we highlight the key enabling technologies: surrogate modelling, in-situ sensing, hardware control systems and intelligent control policies. Our proposed digital twin hierarchy for AM provides a developer framework for engineering digital twins, both for AM and other intelligent manufacturing systems.},

Dimensional control showed that the differences between the original design and the component are below 100μm.

The microstructure was investigated after SLM, HIP and normalizing and tempering treatments. In all cases, it consisted of thin martensitic laths. Subsize tensile samples were extracted from the mock-ups to measure the mechanical tensile properties after each step of the manufacturing process.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16168},
	abstract = {Defects in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parts often result from the meso-scale dynamics of the molten alloy near the laser, known as the melt pool. For instance, the melt pool can directly contribute to the formation of undesirable porosity, residual stress, and surface roughness in the final part. Experimental in-situ monitoring of the three-dimensional melt pool physical fields is challenging, due to the short length and time scales involved in the process. Multi-physics simulation methods can describe the three-dimensional dynamics of the melt pool, but are computationally expensive at the mesh refinement required for accurate predictions of complex effects, such as the formation of keyhole porosity. Therefore, in this work, we develop a generative deep learning model based on the probabilistic diffusion framework to map low-fidelity, coarse-grained simulation information to the high-fidelity counterpart. By doing so, we bypass the computational expense of conducting multiple high-fidelity simulations for analysis by instead upscaling lightweight coarse mesh simulations. Specifically, we implement a 2-D diffusion model to spatially upscale cross-sections of the coarsely simulated melt pool to their high-fidelity equivalent. We demonstrate the preservation of key metrics of the melting process between the ground truth simulation data and the diffusion model output, such as the temperature field, the melt pool dimensions and the variability of the keyhole vapor cavity. Specifically, we predict the melt pool depth within 3 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ based on low-fidelity input data 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ coarser than the high-fidelity simulations, reducing analysis time by two orders of magnitude.},

In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, components are built by selectively melting specific areas of the powder bed, to form the two-dimensional cross-section of the specific part. However, the high occurrence of defects impacts the adoption of this method for precision applications. Therefore, a control policy for dynamically altering process parameters to avoid phenomena that lead to defect occurrences is necessary. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that derives a versatile control strategy for minimizing the likelihood of these defects is presented. The generated control policy alters the velocity of the laser during the melting process to ensure the consistency of the melt pool and reduce overheating in the generated product. The control policy is trained and validated on efficient simulations of the continuum temperature distribution of the powder bed layer under various laser trajectories.},

	abstract = {We introduce an experimental method to image melt pool temperature with a single commercial color camera and compare the results with multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. This approach leverages the principle of two-color (i.e., ratiometric) thermal imaging, which is advantageous because it negates the need for a priori knowledge of melt pool emissivity, plume transmissivity, and the camera’s view factor. The color camera’s ability to accurately measure temperature was validated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) blackbody source and tungsten filament lamp between temperatures of 1600 K and 2800 K. To demonstrate the technique, an off-axis high-speed color camera operating at 22 500 frames per second capturing a 2.8 mm × 2.8 mm area on the build plate was used to image both no-powder and powder single beads on a commercial laser powder bed fusion machine. Melt pool temperature fields for 316L stainless steel at varying processing conditions show peaks between 3300 K and 3700 K depending on the laser power and increased variability in the presence of powder. Measurements of nickel superalloy 718 and Ti-6Al-4V show comparable temperatures, with increased plume obstruction, especially in Ti-6Al-4V due to vaporization of aluminum. Multi-physics CFD models are used to simulate metal melt pools but some parameters such as the accommodation and Fresnel coefficients are not well characterized. Fitting a FLOW-3D® CFD model to ex-situ measurements of the melt pool cross-sectional geometry for 316L stainless steel identifies multiple combinations of Fresnel coefficient and accommodation coefficient that lead to geometric agreement. Only two of these combinations show agreement with the thermal images, motivating the need for thermal imaging as a means to advance validation of complex physics models. Our methodology can be applied to any color camera to better monitor and understand melt pools that yield high-quality parts.},

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

Equiaxed grains were observed more frequently in the region of high G rather than in the region of low G, contrary to the trend of the CET criterion. Computational thermal-fluid dynamics (CtFD) simulation has revealed that the fluid velocity is significantly higher in the case of smaller melt regions. The G on the solidification front of a small melt pool tends to be high, but at the same, the temperature gradient along the melt pool surface also tends to be high. The high melt surface temperature gradient can enhance Marangoni flow, which can apparently reverse the trend of equiaxed grain formation.},

Large two-color pyrometry data sets were used to estimate instantaneous temperatures, melt pool orientations and aspect ratios. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to processed pyrometry data to detect outlier images and conditions. It is shown that melt pool outliers are good predictors of voids observed post-build. With this approach, real time process monitoring can be incorporated into systems to detect defect and void formation. Alternatively, using the methodology presented here, pyrometry data can be post processed for porosity assessment.},

	abstract = {Variability and repeatability challenges in Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) limit its industrial applications. The difficulty of effectively evaluating similar defects with varying severity poses reliability issues for in-situ monitoring based on acoustic monitoring. In the LPBF acoustic monitoring scenario, the original signal amplitude is weak, and the acoustic field coupling information is complex, so it is difficult to directly obtain high-quality and physically reasonable LPBF defect features, which leads to the difficulty of reliably monitoring LPBF defects. This study proposes a novel LPBF pore defect monitoring approach based on acoustic signal physical defect information feature extraction and interpretable deep learning. Firstly, based on the established correlation mechanism among the molten pool, defects, and signals in the LPBF process, the effectiveness of acoustic feature representation in reflecting defect information is demonstrated. Secondly, the TFSST method is proposed to enhance the expression of the most relevant and physically reasonable time-frequency features of weak amplitude LPBF defect signals. Finally, the multi-scale spatially interactive fusion convolutional neural network (MSSIF-CNN) is proposed for in-situ monitoring of LPBF defects using an ABAE monitoring system. The proposed method can recognize five LPBF defects with an accuracy of 99.12 \%. In addition, the visualization results verify that the model possesses superior adaptive defect feature extraction capabilities and effectively focuses on the most relevant and physically reasonable defect characterization information. With millisecond monitoring response times and physically interpretable defect monitoring decision-making capabilities, the method offers the potential for industrialized in-situ monitoring.},

	abstract = {The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7\% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.},

	abstract = {Properties and serviceability of additively manufactured components are affected by their geometry, microstructure and defects. These important attributes are now optimized by trial and error because the essential process variables cannot currently be selected from scientific principles. A recourse is to build and rigorously validate a digital twin of the additive manufacturing process that can provide accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variations of metallurgical parameters that affect the structure and properties of components. Key building blocks of a computationally efficient first-generation digital twin of laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing utilize a transient, three-dimensional model that calculates temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates, solidification parameters and deposit geometry. The measured profiles of stainless steel 316L and Alloy 800H deposits as well as the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and Vickers hardness measurements are used to validate the proposed digital twin. The predicted cooling rates, temperature gradients, solidification rates, SDAS and micro-hardness values are shown to be more accurate than those obtained from a commonly used heat conduction calculation. These metallurgical building blocks serve as a phenomenological framework for the development of a digital twin that will make the expanding knowledge base of additive manufacturing usable in a practical way for all scientists and engineers.},

	abstract = {Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has been extended to multilinguality, that is to handle more than one translation direction with a single system. Multilingual NMT showed competitive performance against pure bilingual systems. Notably, in low-resource settings, it proved to work effectively and efficiently, thanks to shared representation space that is forced across languages and induces a sort of transfer-learning. Furthermore, multilingual NMT enables so-called zero-shot inference across language pairs never seen at training time. Despite the increasing interest in this framework, an in-depth analysis of what a multilingual NMT model is capable of and what it is not is still missing. Motivated by this, our work (i) provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of the translations produced by bilingual, multilingual and zero-shot systems; (ii) investigates the translation quality of two of the currently dominant neural architectures in MT, which are the Recurrent and the Transformer ones; and (iii) quantitatively explores how the closeness between languages influences the zero-shot translation. Our analysis leverages multiple professional post-edits of automatic translations by several different systems and focuses both on automatic standard metrics (BLEU and TER) and on widely used error categories, which are lexical, morphology, and word order errors.},

In this work, we experiment with incorporating richer structural distributions, encoded using graphical models, within deep networks. We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn interesting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple attention.},

To explore the mechanisms of porosity formation at atmospheric pressure and porosity defects mitigation under vacuum, the weld pool and fluid flow behaviors were directly observed by placing a transparent glass plate on one side of the weld pool. The results showed that the vacuum condition was favorable for reducing porosity, especially process porosity. It was also found that the weld pool size and fluid flow were totally different at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. At atmospheric pressure, bubbles were trapped in the vortex induced by two opposing fluid flows, failed to escape from the weld pool and finally formed pores. Under vacuum, suppression of vapor plume and reduction in the boiling point led to a deeper keyhole and a thinner weld pool, resulting in an upward flow in the rear weld pool. In this case, the bubbles could escape easily from the weld pool with the help of the upward flow.},

Furthermore, the non-adaptive nature of FEA requires the entire model to be solved even for minor geometric variations creating a bottleneck during iterative design optimization. This necessitates a framework that can efficiently predict stress distribution in geometries based on given boundary and loading conditions. In this paper, we present StressD, a framework for predicting von Mises stress fields based on the denoising diffusion model. The StressD framework involves two models, a U-net-based denoising diffusion model and an auxiliary network to generate and predict stress distribution in structures. The denoising diffusion model generates a normalized stress map based on the given geometry, boundary conditions and loading condition, while the auxiliary network is used to determine the scaling information needed to un-normalize the generated stress map. We evaluate the StressD framework on cantilever structures and show that it is able to accurately predict von Mises stress fields while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional FEA.},

	abstract = {The inherent complexity of the fluid flow in subsurface systems brings potential inevitable uncertainty in their characterization. Computationally intensive high-dimensional inversion problems often emerge in solving the fluid flow problems of various scenarios, which required to be probed. To improve the efficiency of solving such problems, surrogate strategies are widely used to quantify the uncertainty of underground multiphase flow models. In this paper, a deep learning surrogate model is developed for predicting the time-dependent dynamic multiphase flow in a two-dimensional (2D) channelized geological system. The surrogate model is combined with a residual U-net and an autoregressive strategy, which considers the output at the previous time step as input and predict the output at the current time step. The residual U-net has a symmetric network structure similar to U-net and contains extra residual units. The rich skip connections in the network can promote information dissemination and achieve better prediction performance with fewer parameters. We demonstrated the performance of the autoregressive residual U-net (AR-Runet) for predicting the migration of solute transport in heterogeneous 2D binary model. The result shows the AR-Runet surrogate model can provide an accurate approximation of saturation and pressure fields at different times. We also have demonstrated that with the autoregressive strategy this network can achieve similar predict results with relatively less training data. The performance of the AR-Runet network is also compared with the autoregressive Dense net (AR-Dense). The findings indicate that the AR-Runet can provide effective measures for developing surrogate model and uncertainty analysis in dynamic multiphase flow predictions of subsurface systems.},

	abstract = {Laser Powder-Bed Fusions (LPBF), a class of additive manufacturing (AM), is a promising technique for producing components with complex geometry design. However, parts fabricated by LPBF suffer from residual stresses arising due to substantial temperature gradients inherent to the process. Numerical models are unable to provide a comprehensive thermal history of the built materials efficiently due to the mismatch between the characteristic length scales and infinitesimal time steps needed for complete simulations. In the present work, an extended Rosenthal’s model is presented by considering the effects of various heat dissipation/consumption mechanisms. The modeling results of energy auditing of thermal boundary conditions for stainless steel (SS17-4PH) laser melting indicated that the total energy losses by convection, radiation, and melting are less than 20\% among which, radiation is the most dominant part. A comparison of the results obtained by the extended Rosenthal’s equation with finite element numerical predictions and experimental data shows a good agreement. Also, a parametric study has been conducted to identify the influence of laser scanning velocity, beam radius, and power on the overall temperature distributions and melt geometry. The present study can pave the way for the prospective use of this methodology to conduct further investigation such as microstructure analysis and thermo-mechanical modeling which are needed to predict residual stresses and distortions.},

It was found that some defects of the final components can be attributed to internal porosities of the powders used in the manufacturing process. These internal porosities are a consequence of the gas atomization process used for the production of the powders themselves. Therefore, the importance of using tailored powders, free from porosities, in order to manufacture components with high mechanical properties is highlighted.},

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Therefore, predicting these factors is of high importance. However, simulating such a complex phenomenon is usually very time-consuming and requires huge computational resources. In this work, we create three datasets consisting of single-trail L-PBF processes using the Flow-3D simulation software and use them to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting the three-dimensional temperature field solely by taking the process parameters and the time step as input. The CNN achieves a relative Root Mean Squared Error less of than 5\% for the temperature field in the solidifying region and an average Intersection over Union score of 80\% to 90\% in predicting the three-dimensional geometry of the melt pool. Moreover, since time is included as one of the inputs of the model, the temperature field can be obtained in a matter of a few seconds for any arbitrary time step without the need to iterate and compute all the steps.},

A major goal is to determine the merits and demerits of this analytical equation which can be an alternative to FE analysis, and to evaluate the effect of imperative assumptions on predicted consequences. Using results from the analytical and numerical approaches in conjunction with experiments, different physical features are compared. In this study, the results obtained from experiments in terms of melt pool shapes are compared with the predicted ones achieved from the numerical and analytical approaches in which the FE model is more accurate than the Rosenthal equation in the estimation of the melt pool dimensions. Furthermore, as to the partially melted zones, the estimations achieved from the numerical modeling are more genuine than ones from the analytical equation with regards to the experimental results. At high energy density, near keyhole welding mode, the reported results show that experimental melt widths are supposed to be narrower than the fusion widths estimated by the analytical solution. The primary explanation could be the influence of thermal losses that occurred during convection and radiation, which are neglected in the Rosenthal equation. Additionally, the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) estimated with the numerical modeling and the analytical Rosenthal solution is comparable with the experimental results obtained.},

To date, measuring DED distortions on complex geometries has only been achieved post process, discarding the complex thermomechanical history that leads to that final material state. In this work, surround stereo digital image correlation (DIC) is used to 3D map surfaces and strain tensors in-situ in a powder-blown laser DED system. Infrared thermography is then projected onto these surfaces to record the full thermomechanical history of printed parts. DIC presents a unique challenge to DED AM, as no part exists at the beginning of deposition, which (a) prevents application of an appropriate speckle pattern and (b) denies the user a zero strain reference frame. Solutions to these problems are proposed and their limitations explored herein. In sum, this work presents a relatively low-cost solution to monitoring and optimizing the unique temporal artifacts induced by complex scan strategies that was previously unobtainable.},

	abstract = {A Transformer-based deep direct sampling method is proposed for electrical impedance tomography, a well-known severely ill-posed nonlinear boundary value inverse problem. A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed images. An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. This research shall strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.},

Furthermore, part properties such as mechanical properties, surface roughness, or density exhibit a comparatively low reproducibility. Recent progress in the field of process monitoring, however, indicates that infrared thermography can be used to correlate melt pool temperatures with the resulting part properties. The analysis of the influence of process parameters on the resulting melt pool temperatures has up until now been limited to the evaluation of the maximum temperature during exposure and the mean temperature at arbitrary moments after exposure. However, the cooling rate of the polymer melt is also essential. To prove this hypothesis, a continuous data stream, which enables an automated calculation of characteristic processing times and temperatures, is introduced within the scope of this work. Single-layer specimens are manufactured with various energy inputs, while the resulting temperature of the melt is recorded using thermal imaging. The peak temperatures are combined with the characteristics that describe the temperature decay after exposure, such as a decay time determined at a specific cooling rate. These metrics quantify the cooling behavior of melt pools in a systematic and reproducible way. Furthermore, the sequence of decay values at different cooling rates can potentially be combined with existing process knowledge to differentiate process regimes. The presented approach can be used to create a more in-depth process understanding in later works, thereby enabling applications such as in-situ quality assurance.},

	abstract = {Despite continuous technological enhancements of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, the lack of process repeatability and stability still represents a barrier for the industrial breakthrough. The most relevant metal AM applications currently involve industrial sectors (e.g. aerospace and bio-medical) where defects avoidance is fundamental. Because of this, there is the need to develop novel in situ monitoring tools able to keep under control the stability of the process on a layer-by-layer basis, and to detect the onset of defects as soon as possible. On the one hand, AM systems must be equipped with in situ sensing devices able to measure relevant quantities during the process, a.k.a. process signatures. On the other hand, in-process data analytics and statistical monitoring techniques are required to detect and localize the defects in an automated way. This paper reviews the literature and the commercial tools for in situ monitoring of powder bed fusion (PBF) processes. It explores the different categories of defects and their main causes, the most relevant process signatures and the in situ sensing approaches proposed so far. Particular attention is devoted to the development of automated defect detection rules and the study of process control strategies, which represent two critical fields for the development of future smart PBF systems.},

In the absence of theoretical underpinnings, controlled experiments aimed at explaining these strategies can aid our understanding of deep learning landscapes and the training dynamics. Existing approaches for empirical analysis rely on tools of linear interpolation and visualizations with dimensionality reduction, each with their limitations. Instead, we revisit such analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz., mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons for the success of the heuristics. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA. Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed to the deeper layers.},

Although the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is the most popular option when dealing with natural images, for biomedical image segmentation the soft Dice loss is often preferred due to its ability to handle imbalanced scenarios. On the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully applied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the generalization ability of all these losses in the presence of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time that are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case, we train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we also have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of different loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability to generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation from endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our findings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting in-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data, which leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of problems, due to its robustness and ability to generalize to OoD samples.

They were registered to the original CAD. Dataset for machine learning was assembled from those registered 3D models. The trained machine learning model can precisely predict local porosity caused by lack of fusion and keyhole with multi-layer monitoring images. It also indicates the optimal processing window. It is impossible to be sure about the occurrence of defects in a layer based only on the abnormality of a single layer, and vice versa. Defects in a layer can be caused by improper parameters or anomalies in current layer or subsequent layers; defects in one layer can also be eliminated by proper parameters in the following layers.

The number of research studies in this field has been characterised by significant growth in the last few years, with several advances and new solutions compared with first seminal works. Moreover, industrial powder bed fusion (PBF) systems are increasingly equipped with sensors and toolkits for data collection, visualisation and, in some cases, embedded in-process analysis. Many new methods have been proposed and defect detection capabilities have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, several challenges and open issues still need to be tackled to bridge the gap between methods proposed in the literature and actual industrial implementation. This paper presents an updated review of the literature on in-situ sensing, measurement and monitoring for metal PBF processes, with a classification of methods and a comparison of enabled performances.

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to achieve the defect-free production of parts made using Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. As a step towards this goal, the objective is to detect flaws in AM parts during the process by combining predictions from a physical model (simulation) with in-situ sensor signatures in a machine learning framework. We hypothesize that flaws in AM parts are detected with significantly higher statistical fidelity (F-score) when both in-situ sensor data and theoretical predictions are pooled together in a machine learning model, compared to an approach that is based exclusively on machine learning of sensor data (black-box model) or physics-based predictions (white-box model). We test the hypothesized efficacy of such a gray-box model or digital twin approach in the context of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) AM processes. For example, in the DED process, we first predicted the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature in a thin-wall titanium alloy part using a computational heat transfer model based on graph theory. Subsequently, we combined the preceding physics-derived thermal trends with in-situ temperature measurements obtained from a pyrometer in a readily implemented supervised machine learning framework (support vector machine). We demonstrate that the integration of temperature predictions from an ab initio heat transfer model and in-situ sensor data is capable of detecting flaws in the DED-produced thin-wall part with F-score approaching 90\%. By contrast, the F-score decreases to nearly 80\% when either temperature measurements from the in-situ sensor or temperature distribution predictions from the theoretical model are used alone by themselves. This work thus demonstrates an early foray into the digital twin paradigm for real-time process monitoring in AM via seamless integration of physics-based modeling (simulation), in-situ sensing, and data analytics (machine learning).},

	abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED) is a metal additive manufacturing process, where dimensional accuracy and repeatability are traditionally challenging to achieve. Strategies for computationally inexpensive process modelling and fast-response process controls of the laser deposition process are necessary to keep the geometric features close to the required dimensional tolerances. The deposition geometry depends highly on the complex local laser-material interaction and global thermal history of the substrate. In order to control the deposition geometry, an accurate and computationally inexpensive discretized state space thermal history model coupled with an analytical deposition geometry model is developed in this work. The model accounts for the local laser-material interaction using the mass and energy equilibrium equations coupled in a lumped parameter solution, as well as the global thermal history of the product using a state space thermomechanical discretization. In literature, studies have only focused on 1D toolpaths with constant process parameters such as speed, powder feedrate, and laser power. As it is possible to achieve highly complex geometric shapes with additive manufacturing, it is important to have models compatible with 2D/3D complex toolpaths. In this paper, an analytical thermomechanical model and a coupled deposition geometry model for DED process are presented and experimentally validated. As such, the thermal history of the deposited part is predicted throughout the process and the geometric features are predicted for 2D toolpaths.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in learning task specific features that allow for unprecedented performance on various computer vision tasks. Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) provides several benefits for aerospace companies in terms of efficient and innovative product development. However, due to the general lack of AM process understanding, engineers face many uncertainties related to product qualification during the design of AM components. The aim of this paper is to further the understanding of how to cope with the need to develop process understanding, while at the same time designing products that can be qualified. A qualitative action research study has been performed, using the development of an AM rocket engine turbine demonstrator as a case study. The results show that the qualification approach should be developed for the specific application, dependent on the AM knowledge within the organization. AM knowledge is not only linked to the AM process but to the complete AM process chain. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the manufacturing chain during design and to develop necessary knowledge concurrently with the product in order to define suitable requirements. The paper proposes a Design for Qualification framework, supported by six design tactics. The framework encourages proactive consideration for qualification and the capabilities of the AM process chain, as well as the continuous development of AM knowledge during product development.},

When process outcomes such as strength, density, or precision need to meet certain specifications, changes in process variable selection can be made to meet these requirements. However, the changes required to achieve a better part performance may not be intuitive, particularly because process variable changes can simultaneously improve some outcomes while worsening others. There is great potential to design the additive manufacturing process, tailoring process variables based on user requirements for a given part. In this work, the tradeoffs between multiple process outcomes are formalized and the design problem is explored throughout the design space of process variables. Based on user input for each process outcome considered, P–V (power–velocity) process design charts are introduced, which map the process space and identify the best combination of process variables to achieve a user's desired outcome.},

Limited by the implementation conditions, CT with incomplete projections happens quite often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms are not easy to deal with incomplete data. They are usually involved with complicated parameter selection operations, also sensitive to noise and time-consuming. In this paper, we reported a deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data CT. It is the tight coupling of the deep learning U-net and CT reconstruction algorithm in the domain of the projection sinograms. The U-net estimated results are not the artifacts caused by the incomplete data, but the complete projection sinograms. After training, this framework is determined and can reconstruct the final high quality CT image from a given incomplete projection sinogram. Taking the sparse-view and limited-angle CT as examples, this framework has been validated and demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data sets. Embedded with CT reconstruction, this framework naturally encapsulates the physical imaging model of CT systems and is easy to be extended to deal with other challenges. This work is helpful to push the application of the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in the field of CT.},

The as-built samples show porosity clusters close to the surface, which are attributed to the contour-core scan strategy. In the following steps the effect of shot peening on pore size and morphology in dependency of depth was examined. A strong porosity shrinkage could be achieved in near-surface areas (0–500 μm), but also in depths that did not seem accessible via shot peening, leading to an overall relative porosity reduction between 15–30\%. Furthermore, shot peening led to a pore sphericity increase, especially for large pores. The individual orientation of the pores were compared before and after shot peening, where the former mostly had their longest axis in surface normal direction, while the latter showed a more randomly orientation distribution. X-ray diffractography detected residual compressive stresses for the as-built as well as the shot peened samples. Finally fatigue tests were performed, indicating an increase in low- and high-cycle-fatigue resistance after shot peening by 20 MPa.},

In this paper, results are presented that have been obtained with an off-axis melt pool monitoring system on a 3D Systems ProX DMP 320 using Ti-6Al-4 V ELI. The focus is on the development of a method for predicting the presence and location of lack of fusion porosities as they can have a large impact on part quality and are not always easily detected post-build. The processed signals from the monitoring system are shown to have a high degree of correlation with the presence of lack of fusion porosities as measured by CT scans. A prediction sensitivity of 90\% for lack of fusion events in the range of pores having a volume greater than 0.001 mm3, roughly equivalent to 160 μm in diameter, was obtained.},

The images taken by the UAVs usually suffer from significant size difference when generating the object bounding boxes and uncertain rotation variations. Existing methods are usually designed for city cameras, incapable of handing the rotation issue in UAV scenarios. A straightforward solution is to perform the image-level rotation augmentation, but it would cause loss of useful information when inputting the powerful vision transformer as patches. This motivates us to simulate the rotation operation at the patch feature level, proposing a novel rotation invariant vision transformer (RotTrans). This strategy builds on high-level features with the help of the specificity of the vision transformer structure, which enhances the robustness against large rotation differences. In addition, we design invariance constraint to establish the relationship between the original feature and the rotated features, achieving stronger rotation invariance. Our proposed transformer tested on the latest UAV datasets greatly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, which is 5.9\% and 4.8\% higher than the highest mAP and Rank1. Notably, our model also performs competitively for the person re-identification task on traditional city cameras. In particular, our solution wins the first place in the UAV-based person re-recognition track in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition held in ICCV 2021.

	abstract = {Material Extrusion (ME) is becoming one of the most promising class of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes in the manufacturing panorama for its capability of realizing products with complex shapes, potentially in large dimensions, for a variety of applications and materials for different industrial sectors. Despite the significant advances in material range and machine capabilities, the lack of process stability and repeatability of ME still represents an obstacle for the adoption of this process on large industrial scales. Following the success of in-situ monitoring in other AM technologies, some studies are investigating the possibility of embedding in-situ sensors on commercial machines. Among them, thermal infrared monitoring systems have gained lots of interest for the crucial role of temperature evolution in final part quality and mechanical performance. This study presents a data-driven methodology for in-situ monitoring of thermal profiles. The proposed algorithm extracts, models, and compares the cooling history at different locations. By combining a tracking algorithm and automatic detection of region of interests and robust regression for functional data modeling, we propose a solution to study the cooling history of the 3D printed geometry as the process evolves, to draw general conclusions on the process and detect anomalous thermal profiles, which may entail lack of bonding or other flaws. This paper further proposes a novel approach to automatically detect local temperature inhomogeneities, also known as “hot” and “cold spots”, which are often symptomatic of critical defects in the 3D printed part. In-situ detection of hold- and cold-spots can be particularly useful for large scale products or functional products printing. The proposed methods can be applied to any ME process, but it is specifically applied to a real case study of Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show the effectiveness of all the proposed solutions and pave the way towards zero-defects production.},

If the magnitude of different transformations does not exceed a class- and transformation dependent threshold, both architectures show invariant behavior.

Short layer build times do not provide enough time for the material to cool sufficiently. As a result, an object cannot support its own weight nor deal with overhanging features. Additionally, the generation of support structures may be impractical either due to geometry or, in the case of large-scale polymer additive manufacturing, due to being difficult to remove. To address these issues, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated the use of a thermal camera mounted to a gantry to collect data on an object under construction. This data provided feedback for an in-situ control system to adjust layer build times. Adjustments were made in the form of additional waiting to allow the material to cool to specific thermal thresholds. This additional cooling time allowed the construction of objects with low layer build times or overhanging features that would have otherwise failed.},

	abstract = {Distortions in Additive Manufacturing (AM) Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) occur in the newly-built component due to rapid heating and solidification and can lead to shape deviations and cracking. This paper presents a novel approach to quantify the distortions experimentally and to use the results in numerical simulation validation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is applied together with optical filters to measure in-situ distortions directly on a wall geometry produced with LMD. The wall shows cyclic expansion and shrinking with the edges bending inward and the top of the sample exhibiting a slight u‐shape as residual distortions. Subsequently, a structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the experiment is established, calibrated against experimental temperature profiles and used to predict the in-situ distortions of the sample. A comparison of the experimental and numerical results reveals a good agreement in length direction of the sample and quantitative deviations in height direction, which are attributed to the material model used. The suitability of the novel experimental approach for measurements on an AM sample is shown and the potential for the validated numerical model as a predictive tool to reduce trial-and-error and improve part quality is evaluated.},

While millions of labeled images are available today to build classification tools for natural scenes, the amount of available annotated data for automatic breast cancer screening is limited to a few thousand images, at best. We address these limitations with a method for data augmentation, based on the introduction of random elastic deformations on images of mammograms. We validate this method on three publicly available datasets. Our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is trained for mass classification - in a conventional way -, and then used in the more interesting problem of mass detection in full mammograms by transforming the CNN into a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).},

This cost is even greater in the context of large-scale additive manufacturing where the objects can be very large. As a result, a great deal of research has focused on defect identification and mitigation. To address defects during object construction, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100\% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50\% overfill. Within two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10\% of the expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system can compensate for uneven build surfaces.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

Although transformer-based models are known to only be effective when large training datasets are available, we show how we can effectively regularise the model during training and leverage pretrained image models to be able to train on comparatively small datasets. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics 400 and 600, Epic Kitchens, Something-Something v2 and Moments in Time, outperforming prior methods based on deep 3D convolutional networks.

In this context process monitoring is necessary for documentation, qualification and at the same time it is expected to be able to detect process anomalies during the process. In addition to surface roughness, part density which mostly depends on volume energy, changing with laser power, scan velocity etc., is a distinctive quality feature of every component.

In this work, we introduced a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for melt pool characterization. An extensive experimental dataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM processing conditions, materials, melt pool dimensions, melt pool modes and flaw types. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for melt pool defect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt pool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate melt pool geometry from process parameters and material properties. These models have been shown to outperform Rosenthal estimation for melt pool geometry while maintaining interpretability.},
