Software and computers have now developed to a level where such calculations can be used as tools for material and process development. In the present paper some of the latest software developments at Thermo-Calc Software are presented together with application examples. It is shown how advanced thermodynamic calculations have become more accessible since: \&\#x02022;—{\textbar}A more user-friendly windows version of Thermo-Calc, TCW, has been developed.\&\#x02022;—{\textbar}There is an increasing amount of thermodynamic databases for different materials available.\&\#x02022;—{\textbar}Thermo-Calc can be accessed from user-written software through several different programming interfaces are available which enables access to the thermodynamic software from a user-written software. Accurate data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria can then easily be incorporated into software written in e.g. C++, Matlab and FORTRAN. Thermo-Calc Software also produces DICTRA, a software for simulation of diffusion controlled phase transformations. Using DICTRA it is possible to simulate processes such as homogenization, carburising, microsegregation and coarsening in multicomponent alloys. The different models in the DICTRA software are briefly presented in the present paper together with some application examples.},

	abstract = {Part qualification is often a critical and labor-intensive process in additive manufacturing, particularly in the detection of defects such as porosity, which stands to benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning. We present a deep learning approach for quantifying and localizing ex-situ porosity within Laser Powder Bed Fusion fabricated samples utilizing in-situ thermal image monitoring data. Our goal is to build the real time porosity map of parts based on thermal images acquired during the build. The quantification task builds upon the established Convolutional Neural Network model architecture to predict pore count and the localization task leverages the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms of the novel Video Vision Transformer model to indicate areas of expected porosity. Our model for porosity quantification achieved a R2 score of 0.57 and our model for porosity localization produced an average Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.32 and a maximum of 1.0. This work is setting the foundations of part porosity “Digital Twins” based on additive manufacturing monitoring data and can be applied downstream to reduce time-intensive post-inspection and testing activities during part qualification and certification. In addition, we seek to accelerate the acquisition of crucial insights normally only available through ex-situ part evaluation by means of machine learning analysis of in-situ process monitoring data.},

The various metal AM techniques are compared, with analysis of the strengths and limitations of each.

Point, linear, and plane sources of heat are examined. The solutions obtained are then applied to welding problems. It is shown that these solutions are in good agreement with the experimental results, and that they afford a close analysis of the factors governing the heat flow in welding. The most interesting result of the theory, however, is the derivation of a single formula capable of predicting the time and rate of cooling with a fairly good accuracy for a wide variety of thicknesses of steel, ranges of temperature, and welding conditions. An attempt has been made also to show how this theory could be applied to other problems of metal treatment, such as rate of extrusion in continuous casting, or control of flame-hardening and continuous quenching operations.},

	abstract = {Initially, the CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) method was established as a tool for treating thermodynamics and phase equilibria of multicomponent systems. Since then the method has been successfully applied to diffusion mobilities in multicomponent systems, creating the foundation for simulation of diffusion processes in these systems. Recently, the CALPHAD method has been expanded to other phase-based properties, including molar volumes and elastic constants, and has the potential to treat electrical and thermal conductivity and even two-phase properties, such as interfacial energies. Advances in the CALPHAD method or new information on specific systems frequently require that already assessed systems be re-assessed. Therefore, the next generation of CALPHAD necessitates data repositories so that when new models are developed or new experimental and computational information becomes available the relevant low-order (unary, binary, and ternary) systems can be re-assessed efficiently to develop the new multicomponent descriptions. The present work outlines data and infrastructure needs for efficient CALPHAD assessments and updates, highlighting the requirement for data repositories with flexible data formats that can be accessed by a variety of tools and that can evolve as data needs change. Within these repositories, the data must be stored with the appropriate metadata to enable the evaluation of the confidence of the stored data.},

	abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA), a common approach for simulating stress distribution for a given geometry, is generally associated with high computational cost, especially when high mesh resolution is required. Furthermore, the non-adaptive nature of FEA requires the entire model to be solved even for minor geometric variations creating a bottleneck during iterative design optimization. This necessitates a framework that can efficiently predict stress distribution in geometries based on given boundary and loading conditions. In this paper, we present StressD, a framework for predicting von Mises stress fields based on the denoising diffusion model. The StressD framework involves two models, a U-net-based denoising diffusion model and an auxiliary network to generate and predict stress distribution in structures. The denoising diffusion model generates a normalized stress map based on the given geometry, boundary conditions and loading condition, while the auxiliary network is used to determine the scaling information needed to un-normalize the generated stress map. We evaluate the StressD framework on cantilever structures and show that it is able to accurately predict von Mises stress fields while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional FEA.},

In this work we describe a new way to optimize the process parameters for selective laser melting of a beta solidifying titanium aluminide. This kind of material has so far not been processed successfully by this method. The new approach is easy to conduct and well transferable to other materials. It is based on the fact that the parts generated from selective laser melting can be described by an addition of multiple single tracks. Multiple types of single track experiments are performed and in combination with knowledge from laser welding tests optimized parameter combinations are derived. Compact samples are built with the optimized process parameters and characterized in terms of microstructure, phase composition and mechanical properties. With this technique the generation of a TNMB1 titanium aluminide alloy sample with a density greater than 99\% could be achieved. The mechanical properties are comparable with material produced by conventional techniques.},

Large lack of fusion (LoF) defects (often {\textgreater}1 mm in length) significantly reduce ultimate tensile strength and ductility, as well as accelerate fatigue crack initiation and reduce fatigue life. In comparison, small spherical defects ({\textless}100 μm in diameter) have less effect on tensile and fatigue properties. Fatigue crack growth rate is less severely affected by defects than other properties, showing only local acceleration in the proximity of LoF defects. Therefore, shorter fatigue life is attributed to the role of LoF defects on facilitating fatigue crack initiation and to a lesser extent fatigue crack propagation. Additionally, the fatigue life can be normalized for defects by considering their effect on ultimate tensile strength, suggesting that in the limit of low defect population, the fatigue strength of additively manufactured stainless steel is similar to conventional wrought materials.},

In this work, the length scale of the as-built microstructure of parts built with the alloy AlSi10Mg was measured and compared with the well-known relationship between cell size and cooling rate. Cooling rates during solidification were estimated using the Rosenthal equation. It was found that the solidification structure is the expected cellular combination of silicon with α-aluminum. The dependence of measured cell spacing on calculated cooling rate follows the well-established relationship for aluminum alloys. The implication is that cell spacing can be manipulated by changing the heat input. Microscopy of polished sections through particles of the metal powder used to build the parts showed that the particles have a dendritic-eutectic structure; the dendrite arm spacings in metal powder particles of different diameters were measured and also agree with literature correlations, showing the expected increase in secondary dendrite arm spacing with increasing particle diameter.},

This paper specifically investigates the manufacture of stainless steel (SS) 316L structures via a pulsed selective laser melting (SLM) process, and the underlying causes of property variations (within a functionally-acceptable range) through various material characterization techniques. For this, a design of experiments spanning the volumetric energy density (VED) based process parameter design space was utilized to investigate the range of functionally-acceptable physical/mechanical properties achievable in SS 316L. Five sample conditions (made via different process parameter combinations) were down-selected for in-depth microstructure analysis and mechanical/physical property characterization; these were suitably selected to impart a wide and controllable property range (209–318 HV hardness, 90–99.9\% relative density, and 154–211 GPa modulus). It was observed that property variations resulted from combinations of porosity types/amounts, martensitic phase fractions, and grain sizes. Based on these findings, property-graded standard test specimens were designed and manufactured for further investigation—tensile specimens having a monotonic hardness change along its gauge length, four-point bending specimens with varying elastic moduli as a function of the distance from the neutral axis, and Moore’s rotating beam fatigue specimens with moduli variations based on the distance from the center. Altogether, this work lays the foundation for understanding and designing the local and global mechanical performance of FGAM bulk structures.},

The inputs into the simulation are hatch spacing, layer thickness, and melt-pool cross-sectional area. Melt-pool areas used in the simulations can be obtained from experiments, or estimated with the analytical Rosenthal equation. The necessary material constants, including absorptivity for laser-based melting, have been collated for alloy steels, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys. Comparison with several data sets from the literature shows that the simulations correctly predict process conditions at which lack-of-fusion porosity becomes apparent, as well as the rate at which porosity increases with changes in process conditions such as beam speed, layer thickness and hatch spacing.},

Compared to the virgin powder, the average particle size and oxygen content for the recycled powder are increased by 22\% and 48\%, respectively, which promotes the laser absorptivity of the powder bed from 0.45 to 0.64, resulting in the rapid transitioning of the keyhole to a precarious state. The porosity of the LPBF Hastelloy X alloy manufactured using the recycled powder was 1.47\%, which was significantly higher than that of the parts prepared using the virgin powder. However, only a slight difference in the grain size was observed in the LPBF Hastelloy X alloys manufactured from the virgin and recycled powders. A 20.8\% reduction in the plasticity of the LPBF Hastelloy X manufactured from the recycled powder was observed after six iterations. The evolution of the printed defects evolution during the recycling process was revealed. Importantly, a printed defect diameter larger than 40 µm can significantly affect crack initiation and propagation in LPBF products.},

In this work, a comprehensive investigation of porosity is carried out using gas atomised Inconel 718 powder. In the analysis, a clear distinction is made between two types of porosity; namely lack of fusion and gas porosity. The results show that the two types of porosity are attributed by different factors. The gas porosity, which is more difficult to eliminate than the lack of fusion, can be as high as 0.7\%. The study shows that the gas porosity is dependent on the process parameters and the melt pool dynamics. The flotation of entrapped gas bubbles was analysed, showing that in a stationary melt pool the gas would be retained by Marangoni-driven flow. The overall Marangoni-driven flow of the melt pool is in the order of five times higher than the flotation effect, and this is the reason why the melt pool geometry would tend to dominate the flow direction of the gas bubbles. Through optimisation, the gas porosity can be reduced to 0.037\%.},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to identify the fracture mode and origin of failure in the pulled samples. Microstructural examination on the as-built samples showed that increasing the laser power resulted in the transition of melting mode, from lack of fusion to keyhole, with an increase in part bulk density from 98.86\% to 99.29\%, respectively. It was found that the general bulk porosity level does not correlate directly with the Ultimate Tensile Strength (ranging between 780–820 MPa) and strain to fracture (ranging between 0.2–0.39) behavior of the parts. Detailed pore space characteristics obtained from CT datasets before and after the tensile test contributed to establishing a relationship between defects size, morphology, orientation and tensile properties of the samples. In general, it was found that strain to failure is directly influenced by pore space characteristics, while tensile strength is influenced by a combination of pore space and microstructural characteristics. This study also identified that there are systematic bias effects in the LPBF process, likely introduced by the combination of nuisance variables such as powder layer spreading and gas flow.},

	abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a relatively new manufacturing technique that can be used to process a range of materials. Aluminum alloys are potential candidates for SLM but are more difficult to process than the titanium alloys more commonly used with this technique. This is because of the former’s physical properties that can result in high levels of porosity in the final parts. Although the majority of studies to date into the processing of Al alloys by SLM have considered the development of load bearing objects, in particular porosity reduction and mechanical characterization of the parts, it is also important to study the single tracks formed during the process. This paper studies the effect of changing the scan speed on the formation of fusion lines and single tracks from an Al alloy, as well as their overlap to form a single layer. The geometrical features of the melt pools as well as the boundaries of continuity and/or irregularities were defined and showed dependence on scan speed. Keyhole mode melting domination was observed. The scan tracks and layers were porosity-free suggesting pores to form with layer accumulation. Investigations showed that increasing the layer thickness should be avoided as it promoted defects. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping was implemented to compare the chemical composition distribution in the SLM material and its as-cast counterpart. A fine microstructure with homogenous distribution of the alloying elements was observed. Nanoindentation and EDX were used to establish an understanding of the hardness profile across melt pools of single tracks and their interrelation to the chemical composition. The elemental distribution yielded uniform high nano-hardness with no spatial variation across the SLM material.},

At the core of the framework is the master agent, which interprets the user’s natural language query, identifies the task type, and delegates it to a corresponding task-specific agent equipped with appropriate computational tools. Leveraging databases such as the Materials Project and MatWeb, the framework retrieves and summarizes materials data with grounded, factual responses—addressing a key limitation of vanilla LLMs. In cases where the target material is not found in existing databases, a generative task-specific agent can propose plausible crystal structures. For simulation tasks, dedicated agents extract relevant parameters from the user query to conduct continuum simulations (e.g., Cellular Automata and Monte Carlo Annealing) and atomistic simulations (e.g., Molecular Dynamics) using both established software and custom code. The modular design of these agents and their associated tools enables seamless extensibility, allowing the framework to evolve as new capabilities are integrated.},

	abstract = {This work presents a novel modeling framework combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA), to predict the solidification microstructure evolution of laser powder bed fusion (PBF) fabricated 316 L stainless steel. A CA model is developed which is based on the modified decentered square method to improve computational efficiency. Using this framework, the fluid dynamics of the melt pool flow in the laser melting process is found to be mainly driven by the competing Marangoni force and the recoil pressure on the liquid metal surface. Evaporation occurs at the front end of the laser spot. The initial high temperature occurs in the center of the laser spot. However, due to Marangoni force, which drives high-temperature liquid flowing to low-temperature region, the highest temperature region shifts to the front side of the laser spot where evaporation occurs. Additionally, the recoil pressure pushes the liquid metal downward to form a depression zone. The simulated melt pool depths are compared well with the experimental data. Additionally, the simulated solidification microstructure using the CA model is in a good agreement with the experimental observation. The simulations show that higher scan speeds result in smaller melt pool depth, and lack-of-fusion pores can be formed. Higher laser scan speed also leads to finer grain size, larger laser-grain angle, and higher columnar grain contents, which are consistent with experimental observations. This model can be potentially used as a tool to optimize the metal powder bed fusion process, through generating desired microstructure and resultant material properties.},

	abstract = {Multi-material laser powder bed fusion combines different materials in a single component, enabling enhanced functionalities without additional manufacturing steps. However, joining CuCrZr with 316L is challenging due to property mismatches, often leading to poor interfaces. A novel layer-wise power increment strategy is proposed, starting with low laser power for the initial CuCrZr layer on steel and gradually increasing it for subsequent layers. This approach uses a ring-mode laser to create shallower melt pools, which reduces intermixing but poses a risk of lack of fusion (LoF) defects. A melt pool geometry-based process model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations is developed to predict LoF, optimize power settings, and analyze dynamics not observable experimentally. Experiments show that a saturating exponential power increase reduces LoF up to 24\% compared to a linear strategy. Although minimum power is used at the first interface layer, LoF pores occur between layers 3–8 due to rising thermal conductivity in the growing structure. This effect stabilizes near layer 6, making power control in the first five layers critical. The LoF prediction framework proves effective in developing these parameters. Furthermore, the method confines intermixing to one layer ({\textless}40μm), preventing copper contamination cracking while maintaining robust fusion.},

	abstract = {Current additive manufacturing process development primarily focuses on selecting parameters based on density, with performance tuning typically achieved through post-processing. However, research has shown that many alloys possess a relative broad range of high-density process parameters, and fine-tuning these parameters can enable in-situ heat treatment, thereby adjusting the material's structure and properties. Consequently, the practice of selecting a single process parameter based solely on density for various applications remains open to debate. In this paper, commercial 316L stainless steel is employed as a case study to investigate the relative density, microstructure, and mechanical properties of alloys fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) within the range of high-density parameters. The work revealed that when the volumetric energy density (VED) exceeds 50.0 J/mm3, SS 316L exhibits a wide range of high-density process parameters, with over 99.5 \% relative density observed in 32 parameters. The mechanical properties were tested using the self-developed high-throughput tensile platform, which shown variations in yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation of 79 MPa, 107.1 MPa, and 26.7 \%, respectively within the high-density parameters range. The microstructure of the high-density parameters, including grain size, morphology, grain boundary angle, crystallographic texture, and geometric dislocation density, exhibited significant distinctions. The process-structure-properties linkage was built and strengthen mechanism was quantitively determined. This research provides a comprehensive analysis the variation in microstructure and mechanical properties across wide range of high-density process parameters. Most importantly, this research demonstrates the potential for precisely tuning process parameters to produce high-performance AM parts with programmable properties.},

The purpose was to identify and understand the challenges of fabricating Ti-6Al-4V samples or parts from a deep powder bed (more than 200-mm deep) by SEBM and the necessity of applying post heat treatment. The resulting microstructure and mechanical properties of these Ti-6Al-4V rods were characterized along their building (i.e., axial) direction by dividing each rod into three segments (top, middle, and bottom), both before (i.e., as-built) and after hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The as-built microstructure of each rod was inhomogeneous; it was coarsest in the top segment, which showed a near equilibrium α-β lamellar structure, and finest in the bottom segment, which featured a non-equilibrium mixed structure. The tensile properties varied along the rod axis, especially the ductility, but all tensile properties met the requirements specified by ASTM F3001-14. HIP increased the relative density from 99.03 pct of the theoretical density (TD) to 99.90 pct TD and homogenized the microstructure thereby leading to highly consistent tensile properties along the rod axis. The temperature of the stainless steel substrate used in the powder bed was monitored. The as-built inhomogeneous microstructure is attributed to the temperature gradient in the deep powder bed. Post heat treatment is thus necessary for Ti-6Al-4V samples or parts manufactured from a deep powder bed by SEBM. This differs from the additive manufacturing of small samples or parts from a shallow powder bed (less than 100-mm deep) by SEBM.},

Mechanical and metallurgical analyses were performed on the specimens to determine the samples with the highest strengths and the least porosity. The optimal process parameters were thus defined based on the corresponding experimental conditions. Additionally, the effects of fabricating specimens with both virgin and recycled powders were studied. Scanning electron microscopy and electron-dispersive spectroscopy were performed on both types of powders to determine the starting morphology and composition. The initial tensile results are promising, suggesting that DMLS can produce specimens equal in strength to wrought materials. However, there is evidence of cracking on several of the heat-treated tensile specimens that is unexplained. Several theories point to disturbances in the build chamber environment that went undetected while the specimens were being fabricated.},

After oxidation at 950 °C, an outer Cr2O3 layer and inner Al2O3 are identified as the main oxidation products. Moreover, Nb2O5 and δ(Ni3Nb) phases precipitated after oxidation.

However, conducting experiments to estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes can be laborious and expensive, and they are often limited to specific materials and processes. Machine learning (ML) methods offer a more flexible and cost-effective approach to predicting mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML models for predicting mechanical properties. We compiled an extensive experimental dataset from over 90 MAM articles and data sheets from a diverse range of sources, encompassing 140 different MAM data sheets. This dataset includes information on MAM processing conditions, machines, materials, and resulting mechanical properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation, hardness, and surface roughness. Our framework incorporates physics-aware featurization specific to MAM, adjustable ML models, and tailored evaluation metrics to construct a comprehensive learning framework for predicting mechanical properties. Additionally, we explore the Explainable AI method, specifically SHAP analysis, to elucidate and interpret the predicted values of ML models for mechanical properties. Furthermore, data-driven explicit models were developed to estimate mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties, offering enhanced interpretability compared to conventional ML models.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has transformed the production landscape by enabling the precision creation of complex geometries. However, AM faces limitations when applied to challenging environments, such as elevated surfaces and remote locations. Aerial additive manufacturing, facilitated by drones, presents a solution to these challenges by allowing construction in previously inaccessible areas. However, despite advances in methods for the planning, control, and localization of drones, the accuracy of these methods is insufficient to run traditional feedforward extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes (such as Fused Deposition Manufacturing). Recently, the emergence of LLMs has revolutionized various fields by introducing advanced semantic reasoning and real-time planning capabilities. This paper proposes the integration of LLMs with aerial additive manufacturing to assist with the planning and execution of construction tasks, granting greater flexibility and enabling a feedback-based design and construction system. Using the semantic understanding and adaptability of LLMs, we can overcome the limitations of drone-based systems by dynamically generating and adapting building plans on site, ensuring efficient and accurate construction even in constrained environments. We propose a novel methodology that leverages LLMs to design a construction plan for drone-based manufacturing, and adjust the plan in real time to address any errors that may occur. Our system is able to design and build structures given only a semantic prompt and has shown success in understanding the spatial environment despite tight planning constraints. Our method’s feedback system enables replanning using the LLM if the manufacturing process encounters unforeseen errors, without requiring complicated heuristics or evaluation functions. Combining the semantic planning with automatic error correction, our system achieved a 90\% build accuracy, converting simple text prompts to build structures.},

	abstract = {Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Material extrusion (MEX), a core AM method, produces customized and cost-effective products with minimal waste, challenging traditional subtractive manufacturing. Despite its advantages, MEX remains susceptible to defects that can compromise part quality and function, often requiring expert intervention. Existing rule-based and machine learning approaches struggle to generalize across different printers and sensors, while deep learning methods depend on large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce a process monitoring and control framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous controllers for additive manufacturing. Unlike rule-based or heavily data-dependent approaches, our method requires no domain-specific fine-tuning or training. Instead, the LLM leverages in-context learning, self-prompting, and iterative prompt-reason refinement to evaluate print quality from sequential image captures, detect and classify emerging failure modes, and query and modify the printer for relevant operating parameters. Through this adaptive reasoning process, the LLM not only interprets defects but also improves its own decision-making logic, autonomously formulating and executing corrective actions. This demonstrates a rule-free, self-improving approach to process control that extends beyond traditional quality assurance methods. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing it with a control group of engineers with different levels of AM expertise. The evaluation showed that LLM-based agents not only reliably identified common 3D printing errors such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and poor layer adhesion, but also determined their causes and corrected them without human intervention. In addition to matching expert-level accuracy, the LLM was able to recognize emerging print errors earlier than human experts, highlighting its value as a proactive controller. To further demonstrate generalizability, we deployed and tested the framework on two different 3D printers with distinct sensor setups, confirming its adaptability across hardware. We also performed compression tests on baseline prints and on prints optimized by the LLM, with the optimized parts showing clear improvements in mechanical performance.},

This issue is particularly relevant in large-scale LPBF systems where the laser beam needs to scan a large build area. However, most LPBF modeling studies assume vertical laser radiation. The heat transfer, melt pool, and solidification evolution due to the laser shape variation have not been well addressed and quantified. In the present study, the temperature distribution, melt pool geometry and flow dynamics are captured via numerical modelling, and the grain morphology is characterized under various laser incidence angles. The results show that the melt pool depth becomes shallower, and the width is near the beam size as the laser beam becomes more elongated. The beam shape variation can affect the liquid flow pattern with increasing incidence angle, resulting in a larger vortex at the front of the melt pool and a smaller vortex at the rear of the melt pool. The thermal gradient increases and the solidification rate decreases as the laser incident angle becomes larger. The present study enhances the understanding of multi-physics in the LPBF process.},

Using these modified keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller.

In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED {\textgreater} 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds.

Optimizing densification of materials is thus a key target of SLM as well as other similar methods to achieve the desired properties as per applications. In this study, porosity levels in Stainless Steel (SS) 316L parts manufactured with SLM were studied in relation to the effects of process parameters on microstructure and material hardness. Materials studied were manufactured in the energy density range of 50–80 J/mm3 and investigations have been conducted using various characterization techniques. The current study confirmed a strong relationship of energy density with porosity and hardness and it exhibits as the most influential variable that could control porosity and improve density of materials. In the range of energy density between 50 and 80 J/mm3, porosity decreases nearly exponentially and hardness increases linearly, with increasing energy density. The result is well in agreement with reports in the literature and demonstrates fabrication of SS316L with SLM to a highest density ({\textgreater}99.8\%) and predicts possibility of optimization to achieve maximum density by further increasing energy density. In addition to austenite (γ), the analysis of microstructure with TEM reveals presence of tiny structures of martensite and/or ferrite in the austenite matrix of the SLM-fabricated SS316L.},

	abstract = {The effective absorptivity of continuous wave 1070nm laser light has been studied for bare and metal powder-coated discs of 316L stainless steel as well as for aluminum alloy 1100 and tungsten by use of direct calorimetric measurements. After carefully validating the applicability of the method, the effective absorptivity is plotted as a function of incident laser power from 30 up to ≈540W for scanning speeds of 100, 500 and 1500mms−1. The effective absorptivity versus power curves of the bulk materials typically show a slight change in effective absorptivity from 30W until the onset of the formation of a recoil pressure-induced surface depression. As observed using high-speed video, this change in surface morphology leads to an increase in absorption of the laser light. At the higher powers beyond the keyhole transition, a saturation value is reached for both bare discs and powder-coated disks. For ≈100μm thick powder layers, the measured absorptivity was found to be two times that of the bare polished discs for low-laser power. There is a sharp decrease when full melting of the powder tracks is achieved, followed by a keyhole-driven increase at higher powers, similar to the bare disc case. It is shown that, under conditions associated with laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, absorptivity values can vary greatly, and differ from both powder-layer measurements and liquid metal estimates from the literature.},

The aluminide coatings were evaluated utilizing X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and nanoindentation techniques. In addition, the oxidation performances of the aluminide coatings were compared with as-built WAAM IN625 samples based on their exposure in the open-air environment for 5, 25, and 50 h at 1000 °C. The aluminizing process provided a dense aluminide coating with a thickness of 35 µm, continuous throughout the surface. The coating layer consists of mainly NiAl, Ni2Al3, Cr2Al, and MoAl5 phases and exhibited a nano-hardness of 12.85 ± 0.43 GPa. Moreover, the applied heat treatment also improved the surface hardness and elasticity modules of WAAM Inconel 625. The stability of aluminide phases (NiAl, Ni2Al3) at temperatures exceeding 1000 ℃ and the formation of stable Al2O3 oxide islands on the surface provided 6.63 times, 2.70 times, and 2.65 times better oxidation resistance in the aluminized samples than the as-built WAAM IN625 in the 5 h, 25 h and 50 h oxidation periods at 1000 ℃, respectively. In contrast, the increase in the oxidation time changed the oxidation mechanism of as-built WAAM IN625 from Cr2O3 to Cr2O3 and spinel phases such as NiCr2O4, NiMoO4, and NiO. On the other hand, the increase in the oxidation time in aluminized samples caused Kirkendall voids formation and their degradation. Therefore, it was concluded that the mechanical properties could be improved, and the oxidation resistance of these alloys could be improved with the aluminizing heat treatment.},

The complexity of experimental exploration drives the need for high-throughput computational frameworks. This study introduces a framework that integrates material properties, processing parameters, and melt pool profiles from three thermal models to assess process-induced defects, such as lack-of-fusion, balling, and keyholing. A deep learning surrogate model accelerates the printability assessment by 1000 times without losing accuracy. We validate the framework with printability maps for the equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi system and apply it to explore printable alloys in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni high-entropy alloy space. Ensemble probabilistic printability maps further provide insights into defect likelihood and uncertainty, enhancing alloy design for AM by efficiently navigating vast design spaces.},

	abstract = {The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite α′ phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of α and β for heat treating temperatures below the β-transus (995°C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the β-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large β grains are formed which transform to lamellar α+β upon cooling. Post treating at 850°C for 2h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84±1.36\%, compared to 7.36±1.32\% for as-built parts.},

	abstract = {Electron beam melting (EBM®)-built Ti–6Al–4V has increasingly shown great potential for orthopedic implant and aerospace applications in recent years. The microstructure and mechanical properties of EBM-built Ti–6Al–4V have been systematically investigated in this work. Its microstructure consists of columnar prior β grains delineated by wavy grain boundary α and transformed α/β structures with both cellular colony and basket-weave morphology as well as numerous singular α bulges within the prior β grains. The β phase is found to form as discrete flat rods embedded in continuous α phase and its volume fraction is determined to be ∼3.6\%. Moreover, α′ martensite was not observed as it has decomposed into α and β phases. In particular, the α/β interface was studied in detail combined transmission electron microscopy with atom probe tomography. Of note is that graded Ti–6Al–4V microstructure i.e. both prior β grain width and β phase interspacing continuously increase with the build height, was observed, which mainly arises from the decreasing cooling rate. Furthermore, an increasingly pronounced strain hardening effect was also observed as the previously built layers undergo a longer annealing compared to the subsequent layers. As a result, graded mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V with degraded microhardness and tensile properties were found. A good agreement with the Hall–Petch relation indicates that the graded property takes place mainly due to the graded microstructure. In addition, this graded microstructure and mechanical properties were discussed based on a quantitative characterization.},

Successful processing for one material, might not necessarily apply to a different material. This paper describes a workflow process that aims at creating a material data sheet standard that describes regimes where the process can be expected to be robust. The procedure consists of building a Gaussian process-based surrogate model of the L-PBF process that predicts melt pool depth in single-track experiments given a laser power, scan speed, and laser beam size combination. The predictions are then mapped onto a power versus scan speed diagram delimiting the conduction from the keyhole melting controlled regimes. This statistical framework is shown to be robust even for cases where experimental training data might be suboptimal in quality, if appropriate physics-based filters are applied. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a high-fidelity simulation model of L-PBF can equally be successfully used for building a surrogate model, which is beneficial since simulations are getting more efficient and are more practical to study the response of different materials, than to re-tool an AM machine for new material powder.},

	abstract = {The mechanical and microstructural properties of 316L stainless steel (SS) fabricated via Direct Laser Deposition (DLD), a laser-based additive manufacturing method, are presented and compared with those of conventionally-built counterparts. Using a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®) DLD system, the time interval between successive layer deposits, or inter-layer/idle time, for fabricating cylindrical specimens vertically-upward was varied by building either one or nine samples per build plate – thus increasing total assembly volume per build. Subsequently, the effect of thermal history, as well as heat treatment, on microstructural (i.e. grain size and morphology) and mechanical (i.e. tensile, compression, and microhardness) properties of DLD parts were investigated. Results indicate that the DLD 316L SS samples produced herein have a higher yield and ultimate tensile strength relative to their cast and wrought forms. Furthermore, the thermal history, microstructural evolution, and mechanical properties of DLD 316L SS are shown to be dependent on the time interval between deposits. Longer local time intervals result in higher cooling rates, leading to finer microstructures, higher/uniform strength and lower elongation to failure. In addition, porosity and less integral metallurgical bonds are found to be more prevalent in locations further upward from the build plate due to reduced laser penetration depths (e.g. previous-layer remelting decreases). Conversely, parts manufactured with shorter time intervals were found to possess a coarser microstructure, lower strength and higher elongation to failure – attributable to lower cooling rates caused by an increased bulk temperature in the part. These results may aid in future design and control of more efficient, constant-power DLD processes – especially with regard to building multiple and/or larger parts; an approach desirable for minimizing small-to-medium lot production times.},

However, moving from these bespoke applications to high-volume commercial manufacturing requires higher levels of predictability and control of part properties. Detailed simulations of the LPBF process can assist this transition by providing understanding of defect mechanisms and guiding paths to improvement. An accurate value of laser absorptivity for the material is critical for LPBF simulation but the published literature contains surprisingly little absorptivity data applicable to actual LPBF operating conditions. Here we determine the in-situ laser absorptivity of the alloy Ti-6Al-4V during LPBF to be 0.27 +/- 0.03, for a laser wavelength of 1.07 μm. Our technique involves calibrating melt pool CFD simulations against single-track experiments conducted over a range of energy densities and can be extended to other materials. The simulations incorporate multiple laser reflections and cover the transition from conduction to keyhole mode. We also discuss physical mechanisms that may be responsible for changes in the absorption behaviour at high laser energy density which are observed in this and other work.},

	abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) enables the additive manufacturing of complex lattice structures. However, the fabrication of lattice structures via LPBF poses challenges in achieving the intended geometrical accuracy due to their inherent complexity. This study investigates the effects of LPBF processing parameters, specifically laser power and scanning speed, on the geometrical characteristics, surface quality, and mechanical behavior of Inconel 718 lattices structures. The results reveal that processing parameters required for the fabrication of near-full dense structures do not translate effectively to lattice configurations, as variations in energy input influence lattice geometry and surface quality. In this work, strut thickness, open-pore size, open-cell porosity, and surface roughness were measured, and the mechanical properties of the lattices were evaluated under shear loading. The findings indicate that lower energy inputs, achieved by reducing laser power and increasing scanning speed, yield porous structures but lead to mechanical degradation. In contrast, high energy inputs lead to lattices with enhanced strength but result in undesirable open-pore blockage and dimensional inaccuracies. These findings provide insights into tailoring LPBF parameters for dimensional accuracy in lattices and correlating the processing parameters to mechanical performance and surface roughness.},

	abstract = {Metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) provides the means to fabricate complex metallic parts with reduced time to market and material waste and improved design freedom. Industries with strict materials qualifications such as aerospace, biomedical, and automotive are increasingly looking to AM to meet their production needs. However, significant materials-related challenges impede the widespread adoption of these technologies for critical components. In particular, fatigue resistance in as-built parts has proven to be inferior and unpredictable due to the large and variable presence of porosity. This presents a challenge for the qualification of any load bearing part without extensive post-processing, such as Hot Isostatic Pressing, and thorough inspection. Improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind defect formation will assist in designing process improvements to minimize or eliminate defects without relying entirely on post-processing. In this work, the effects of powder, processing parameters, and post-processing on porosity formation in powder-bed metal AM processes are investigated using X-ray microtomography and a newly developed in-situ high speed radiography technique, Dynamic X-ray Radiography. High resolution X-ray computed tomography is used to characterize defect morphology, size, and spatial distribution as a function of process and material inputs. Dynamic X-ray Radiography, which enables the in-situ observation of the laser-metal interactions at frame rates on the order of 100 kHz (and faster), is utilized to understand the dynamic behavior and transitions that occur in the vapor depression across process space. Experimental validation of previously held assumptions regarding defect formation as well as new insights into the influence of the vapor cavity on defect formation are presented.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of powder-bed-based additive manufacturing (AM) technologies during the production of metallic components using Inconel 625 powder material. The AM technologies explored in this study include electron beam powder bed fusion (EPBF), laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), and binder jetting technology. Samples were fabricated in two build directions (X and Z build orientations) for this evaluation process, where all specimens underwent a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-process. The comparison was made in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties including ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), percent elongation, and modulus of elasticity (E). Microstructural characterization showed evidence of equiaxed grain formation for binder jetting and LPBF parts, whereas EPBF parts displayed a more columnar grain formation parallel to the build direction. Six specimens were tested per technology, three built in the X orientation and three built in the Z orientation. All six specimens were built in a single run of each AM machine. Results indicated that all three technologies are capable of meeting the minimum requirements of the ASTM F3056-14 standard for parts produced in the X orientation, with properties that are similar to wrought Inconel 625. In the Z orientation, however, only LPBF was able to meet the minimum standard requirements. Through the comparative analysis of the mechanical properties, this work showed that LPBF outperformed the other technologies in a majority of the evaluated properties, followed by EPBF and binder jetting. An analysis of the fracture surfaces of tensile specimens was also performed, and it indicated ductile fracture (dimple rupture) for the specimens produced with all three of the AM technologies studied. Nevertheless, the characterization also showed certain differences in the fractured surfaces, such as the presence of un-sintered powder particles for the binder jetting processed Inconel 625, or the development of the so called woody structure for the EPBF processed material. This study can be used to determine distinct characteristics between the three powder-bed-based technologies for the fabrication of Inconel 625 that can further include other technologies and materials using similar approaches.},

However, preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.},

The phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity can be predicted from the knowledge of θD¯(∞) and γ(∞).

Early adopters of the technology like the biomedical and aerospace industries have shown that the better-designed components offer substantial performance improvements over current designs. However, in-depth and comprehensive views on the microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured metals and alloys are less reported. To realize the full design potential that metal AM can offer, especially for load-bearing structural components, it is imperative to provide a thorough understanding on the anisotropic and heterogeneous microstructure and mechanical properties that often occur within metal AM parts. This paper outlines a broad range of metal AM technologies and reviews literatures on the anisotropy and heterogeneity of microstructure and mechanical properties for metal AM parts. It can be highlighted that the contributing factors to the anisotropy and heterogeneity within metal AM parts were either their unique microstructural features or manufacturing deficiencies. Concluding remarks on the state-of-the-art research regarding this topic and the possible solutions to overcome the anisotropy and heterogeneity of metal AM parts are provided.},

Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks.

The concerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts.

In the case of metal additive manufacturing (AM), in contrast, the alloys typically used a feedstock were originally developed having other traditional manufacturing technologies in mind. Since metal AM processes involve fundamentally different physics, it is common to encounter many challenges when processing these materials such as high susceptibility to defects and microstructure inconsistencies. Recent research directions call for developing new materials and alloys specifically for AM. This poses a new and significant challenge: how can we determine the optimal processing recipes for an alloy not previously investigated. This is a typically time-consuming and expensive endeavor and, in this work, we propose an efficient framework to efficiently and effectively determine the processing parameter window of a given alloy considered as potential feedstock for AM. The framework integrates design of experiments, physics-based simulation, uncertainty analysis and fabrication and characterization in order to determine the bounding region in the manufacturing space resulting in near full density, defect-free parts. The proposed framework is developed aiming at maximizing its efficiency, accessibility and practicality. We validate the proposed framework and demonstrate its robustness using three model materials, two of which have not been previously reported.},

	abstract = {In additive manufacturing, the optimal processing conditions need to be determined to fabricate porosity-free parts. For this purpose, the design space for an arbitrary alloy needs to be scoped and analyzed to identify the areas of defects for different laser power-scan speed combinations and can be visualized using a printability map. Constructing printability maps is typically a costly process due to the involvement of experiments, which restricts their application in high-throughput product design. To reduce the cost and effort of constructing printability maps, a fully computational framework is introduced in this work. The framework combines CALPHAD models and a reduced-order model to predict material properties. THen, an analytical thermal model, known as the Eagar-Tsai model, utilizes some of these materials' properties to calculate the melt pool geometry during the AM processes. In the end, printability maps are constructed using material properties, melt pool dimensions, and commonly used criteria for lack of fusion, balling, and keyholing defects. To validate the framework and its general application to laser powder-bed fusion alloys, five common additive manufacturing alloys are analyzed. Furthermore, NiTi-based alloys at three different compositions are evaluated to show the further extension of the framework to alloy systems at different compositions. The defect regions in these printability maps are validated with corresponding experimental observations to compare and benchmark the defect criteria and find the optimal criterion set with the maximum accuracy for each unique material composition. Furthermore, printability maps for NiTi that are obtained from our framework are used in conjunction with process maps resulting from a multi-model framework to guide the fabrication of defect-free additive manufactured parts with tailorable properties and performance.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has rapidly changed both large- and small-scale production environments across many industries. By re-envisioning parts from the ground up, not limited to the challenges presented by traditional manufacturing techniques, researchers and engineers have developed new design strategies to solve large-scale materials and design problems worldwide. This is particularly true in the world of alloy design, where new metallic materials have historically been developed through tedious processes and procedures based primarily on casting methodologies. With the onset of directed energy deposition (DED) and powder bed fusion (PBF)-based AM, new alloys can be innovated and evaluated rapidly at a lower cost and considerably shorter lead time than has ever been achieved. This article details the advantages, challenges, applications, and perspectives of alloy design using primarily laser-based AM. It is envisioned that researchers in industry and academia can utilize this work to design new alloys leveraging metallic AM processes for various current and future applications.},

The use of additive manufacturing technology enables the creation of intricate structures with biomimetic characteristics. Three-dimensional (3D) printed titanium orthopaedic implants were already used to repair severe pelvic bone abnormalities, and the production of thousands of non-individualized implants. The various adjustable variables in the 3D printing process and how they could interact with the potential variety of designs that might be produced must be understood in order to predict the efficacy and safety of AM made implants. A reasonably well-known technology known as powder bed 3D printing has revolutionised the process of creating personalised, multipurpose metallic implants for each patient's unique demands. Precise mechanical characteristics with porous implants, good pore topologies, and patient-oriented design functionalities can be created via AM. Although 3D printed Ti and its alloy Ti-6Al-4V have been studied and used in clinical applications from several years, further study is still needed to build porous AM titanium implants that would operate superbly over the long term. Although early clinical outcomes for 3D printed cups have been promising, additional extensive study is still needed, because regulatory approval systems have not fully kept up with technological innovation. For various applications, a variety of 3D printing methods, including selective laser melting, selective laser sintering, and electron beam melting, are discussed in this paper. The production of excellent porous metal implants has a lot of potential for additive manufacturing using powder bed fusion.},

Countless businesses in automotive, aerospace, medical, and even food industries have adopted this approach over the past decade.

This means throughout a single component, properties like hardness, corrosion resistance, and environmental adaptation can be defined in areas that require it the most. These new processes allow for exciting multifunctional parts to be built that were never possible through traditional, single material AM processes. AM of metals, ceramics, and polymers is currently being evaluated to combine multiple materials in one operation and has already produced never-before-produced parts. While multi-material AM is still in its infancy, researchers are shifting their mindset toward this unique approach showing that the technology is beginning to advance past a research and development stage into real-world applications.

	abstract = {A new class of alloys called magnesium-based alloys has the unique property of being biodegradable inside the humans and animals. In addition to being biodegradable, Mg-based alloys are suitable materials for creating medical implants for utilization in orthopaedic and traumatology therapies due to their inherent biocompatibility and bone-like density. Due to the combination of bioimplant design and manufacturing techniques appropriate to particular applications, additive manufacturing (AM) and three-dimensional (3D) printing now offer a potential production approach. Magnesium (Mg) use in biomedical field is rising year by year due to rising needs in the biomedical sector. In this biomedical field, additive manufacturing (AM) gives you the freedom to create components with complicated shapes and good dimensional stability. Additionally, it opens up a new opportunity for using unique component architectures, expanding the uses for magnesium alloy. The numerous AM techniques utilised to create biomedical implants from magnesium-based alloys were rigorously examined in current study, along with the materials, microscopic structure, mechanical characteristics, biocompatibility, biodegradability and antibacterial properties. It was observed that powder bed fusion (PBF) is a very good method for manufacturing magnesium implants as topology can be carefully controlled in powder bed fusion process. It was observed that selective laser melting process offer more functionality than selective laser sintering process because Mg is completely melted and penetrated deeply during selective laser melting process. Selective laser melting has advantages such as smaller grains, a homogenous phase distribution, an improved solid solution rapid solidification and considerable cooling rates. In this article the difficulties and problems associated with AM methods were recognised from the viewpoints of bioimplant design, characteristics, and applications. Critical exploration is also done on the difficulties and potential of AM of magnesium alloys.},

Inspired by the porous structure of cancellous bone, 15 groups of bone scaffolds with variable irregularity (Ir1-5) and porosity (35.53–61.75\%) were designed and fabricated by ceramic digital light processing (DLP) using 20 wt\% hydroxyapatite doped zirconia as the matrix material. The effects of structural parameters and material on mechanical properties and biocompatibility were studied. The shrinkage test results showed that the density of scaffolds was mainly affected by the porosity. The mechanical test results showed that Ir2 and Ir3 scaffolds had better compressive behaviors, and the compressive strength could be increased by 30\% by regulating the irregularity. All scaffolds showed comparable mechanical properties to that of cancellous bone. Cell experiments showed that the effect of structure on cell proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization was most evident at the early stage of implantation. Meanwhile, the biocompatibility variation with the irregularity was consistent with mechanical properties. This study proved that a bio-inspired bone scaffold with excellent comprehensive properties could be obtained through reasonable design.},

Reflectance measurements were carried out using an Ulbricht integrating sphere during static tests and single L-PBF tracks.

These fields are enforced only within a relatively small computational region encompassing the melt pool, while heat diffusion effects elsewhere are solved via the FEM. For a wide range of laser power and scan speeds covering the conduction, transition, and keyhole melting regimes, 29 of the 30 total CIFEM-simulated melt pool sizes lie within two standard deviations of the experimental melt pool sizes. Compared with the CFD simulations, the thermal fields obtained by CIFEM possess 7.44\% mean absolute relative error (MARE), significantly less than the 43.76\% MARE on three representative test cases simulated using the Goldak heat source model calibrated to the measured melt pool dimensions. In terms of computational efficiency, the CIFEM model running on a GPU card with 4,608 Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores is 28.2× more efficient than the CFD simulations running on 24 CPU cores in parallel.},

More importantly, the determination of optimal process windows and even feed-forward and in-line feedback control of the manufacturing process require computationally cheap, fast-acting, quantitative models connecting (local) processing parameters to melt and solidification conditions. Initially developed in the context of welding, the Eagar-Tsai (E-T) model stands out among the most widely used computationally cheap models to predict melt pool characteristics during AM. Despite its widespread use, its statistical validity in the context of AM has yet to be thoroughly verified. In this work, we study the E-T model in a systematic manner, from an uncertainty quantification/propagation (UQ/UP) perspective. E-T model parameters are calibrated against high quality single-track experimental data on the melt pool geometries of several materials through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Posterior distributions of the model parameter values are then propagated. We find that there are considerable discrepancies between predicted and measured melt pool depths when process conditions correspond to keyholing. We then apply a physics-based correction and find that it is possible to achieve much better agreement with experiments without increasing significantly the complexity of the E-T model. Although there might be some uncertainties due to the missing physics and assumptions in the model, the model accuracy and trend are satisfactory for the purpose of accelerated product design under uncertainty.},

Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication protocol over RESTful HTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable agent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and integration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs).A2A enables peer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting secure and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP supports open-network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging, session-aware interaction, and both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based deployments, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.},

	abstract = {Parser-based log compressors have been widely explored in recent years because the explosive growth of log volumes makes the compression performance of general-purpose compressors unsatisfactory. These parser-based compressors preprocess logs by grouping the logs based on the parsing result and then feed the preprocessed files into a general-purpose compressor. However, parser-based compressors have their limitations. First, the goals of parsing and compression are misaligned, so the inherent characteristics of logs were not fully utilized. In addition, the performance of parser-based compressors depends on the sample logs and thus it is very unstable. Moreover, parser-based compressors often incur a long processing time. To address these limitations, we propose Denum, a simple, general log compressor with high compression ratio and speed. The core insight is that a majority of the tokens in logs are numeric tokens (i.e. pure numbers, tokens with only numbers and special characters, and numeric variables) and effective compression of them is critical for log compression. Specifically, Denum contains a Numeric Token Parsing module, which extracts all numeric tokens and applies tailored processing methods (e.g. store the differences of incremental numbers like timestamps), and a String Processing module, which processes the remaining log content without numbers. The processed files of the two modules are then fed as input to a general-purpose compressor and it outputs the final compression results. Denum has been evaluated on 16 log datasets and it achieves an 8.7\%-434.7\% higher average compression ratio and 2.6x-37.7x faster average compression speed (i.e. 26.2MB/S) compared to the baselines. Moreover, integrating Denum's Numeric Token Parsing into existing log compressors can provide an 11.8\% improvement in their average compression ratio and achieve 37\% faster average compression speed.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a layer-by-layer material deposition process that allows for more manufacturing flexibility and design complexity than traditional manufacturing processes. However, the print quality in metal AM is hard to be predicted and controlled due to its high process variability. Numerous process parameters are correlated/intertwined and have a direct/indirect relationship with the final build quality. However, these interconnections among the process parameters and print qualities are not yet fully understood and identified. To achieve a functional part without additional post-processing to improve the surface finish/mechanical properties, the comprehensive process model, which includes the semantic and qualitative connections among the process inputs-signatures-qualities, is urgently needed. Currently, surrogate models (regression models/ physical-based models) are widely used for predicting part qualities, specifically thermal distortion. These surrogate models can provide a simulated result based on the user-defined parameter settings. However, the reverse determination of the highly correlated parameters that can manage the print qualities in the desired standard cannot be achieved through these surrogate models. Understanding this interconnectivity is the top priority in building process models that will help to make the process more predictable and controllable. An ontology-based process map that captures the complicated metal AM processes, including all input parameters, physical, thermal model, and resultant build qualities (microstructure and mechanical properties), is provided in this manuscript. The connections among these factors are used to diagnose the relevant process variables regarding the specific build qualities, which can further combine with experimental data to contribute to a “printable” zone. The ontology-based process map links variable selection to quality requirements, creating a printable zone. A printable zone indicates the allowable process parameter selections, contributing to the desired part quality. Ultimately, the selected variable process data from the ontological process map will scope the parametrical analysis. The implementations of the ontology-based process map and printable zone are presented to demonstrate this proposed method's effectiveness by demonstrating that the proposed printable zone's validity and desired build quality can be achieved.},

To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of these generated sequences, we established a comprehensive evaluation pipeline consisting of ideas from bioinformatics to retain valid proteins with ordered structures. First, we rank the generated sequences based on their perplexity scores, then we filter out those lying outside the permissible convex hull of proteins. Finally, we predict the structure using ESMFold and select the proteins with pLDDT values greater than 70 to ensure ordered structure. The properties of generated sequences are evaluated using task-specific classifiers - PeptideBERT and HAPPENN. We achieved an accuracy of 76.26\% in hemolytic, 72.46\% in non-hemolytic, 78.84\% in non-fouling, and 68.06\% in solubility protein generation.

To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses.

Prevailing methods, notably graph neural networks (GNNs), demand precise atomic coordinates for constructing graph representations, while the integration of observable attributes remains challenging. This research introduces CatBERTa, an energy prediction Transformer model that uses textual inputs. Built on a Transformer encoder pretrained for language modeling purposes, CatBERTa processes human-interpretable text, incorporating target features. Attention score analysis reveals CatBERTa’s focus on tokens related to adsorbates, bulk composition, and their interacting atoms. Moreover, interacting atoms emerge as effective descriptors for adsorption configurations, while factors such as the bond length and atomic properties of these atoms offer limited predictive contributions. In predicting the adsorption energy from textual representations of initial structures, CatBERTa exhibits a precision comparable to that of conventional GNNs. Notably, in subsets recognized for their high accuracy with GNNs, CatBERTa consistently achieves a mean absolute error of 0.35 eV. Furthermore, the subtraction of the CatBERTa-predicted energies effectively cancels out their systematic errors by as much as 19.3\% for chemically similar systems, surpassing the error reduction observed in GNNs. This outcome highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of the energy difference predictions. This research establishes a fundamental framework for text-based catalyst property prediction without relying on graph representations while also unveiling intricate feature–property relationships.},

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture.

However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7\% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35\% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7\% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7\% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.},

This process involves finding the lowest energy among different adsorption configurations on a catalytic surface, which often have very similar energies. Although graph neural networks have shown great success in computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates. By contrast, transformer-based language models can directly use human-readable text inputs, potentially bypassing the need for detailed atomic positions or topology; however, these language models often struggle with accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations. Our study improves the predictive language model by aligning its latent space with well-established graph neural networks through a self-supervised process called graph-assisted pretraining. This method reduces the mean absolute error of energy prediction for adsorption configurations by 7.4–9.8\%, redirecting the model’s attention towards adsorption configuration. Building on this, we propose using generative large language models to create text inputs for the predictive model without relying on exact atomic positions.

	abstract = {Powder bed fusion-laser beam (PBF-LB) parts experience a significant decline in fatigue performance when process-induced defects are present. In this work, a decline in 4-point bend fatigue life was observed in PBF-LB Ti–6Al–4V coupons fabricated at constant power with increasing scanning velocity and which underwent subsequent stress relief and surface machining. Specifically, the presence of pores that resemble lack-of-fusion (LoF) and a decline in fatigue life were observed at scanning velocities lower than that expected from prior published work. It was hypothesized that this unexpected presence of LoF pores resulted from melt pool geometry variability that was not considered in prior work when the LoF criterion was implemented. Further, these pores can be small in size and infrequent in their occurrence when the melt pool geometry variability is not severe. Such sparse pores are challenging to characterize using conventional 2D characterization methods. This work leverages tall and narrow coupon geometry and high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (X-μCT) to capture LoF porosity. The results show that a modified melt pool overlap-based LoF criterion considering melt pool geometry variability captures the unexpected occurrence of LoF pores observed in X-μCT. In addition, the LoF percent metric displays a strongly negative correlation with fatigue performance. The insights from this work provide guidance on characterizing melt pool geometry variability across scan lines to systematically evaluate processing parameters that generate LoF pores, which, in turn, could lower fatigue performance.},

We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and future research directions.},

	abstract = {A multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate involving Gaussian processes (GPs) is used for designing temporal process maps in laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing (AM). Process maps are used to establish relationships between the melt pool properties (e.g., melt pool depth) and process parameters (e.g., laser power and scan velocity). The MFGP surrogate involves a high-fidelity (HF) and a low-fidelity (LF) model. The Autodesk Netfabb® finite element model (FEM) is selected as the HF model, while an analytical model developed by Eagar-Tsai is chosen as the LF one. The results show that the MFGP surrogate is capable of successfully blending the information present in different fidelity models for designing the temporal forward process maps (e.g., given a set of process parameters for which the true depth is not known, what would be the melt pool depth?). To expand the newly-developed formulation for establishing the temporal inverse process maps (e.g., to achieve the desired melt pool depth for which the true process parameters are not known, what would be the optimal prediction of the process parameters as a function of time?), a case study is performed by coupling the MFGP surrogate with Bayesian Optimization (BO) under computational budget constraints. The results demonstrate that MFGP-BO can significantly improve the optimization solution quality compared to the single-fidelity (SF) GP-BO, along with incurring a lower computational budget. As opposed to the existing methods that are limited to developing steady-state forward process maps, the current work successfully demonstrates the realization of temporal forward and inverse process maps in L-DED incorporating uncertainty quantification (UQ).},

Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.},

To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and {\textbackslash}squad benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

	abstract = {Balling is one of the cornerstone defects in laser powder bed fusion of metals, leading to high porosity of the 3D printed parts and substantially deteriorating their performance. The transition to the balling mode is commonly identified through a series of trial-and-error experiments, an extremely inefficient approach. Here, we propose an outstandingly simple thermal scaling model for predicting the threshold from balling mode to conduction mode in laser powder bed fusion. The resulting balling criterion can be expressed as a dimensionless number which combines the material properties, the powder size and the pre-heating of the substrate. The model predictions are well in agreement with our validation experiments for three different materials (copper, bronze and steel). The applicability of the model assumptions is verified through a set of suitably designed multiphysics computational fluid dynamics simulations. The combination of first-hand experiments and simulations substantiates the balling model as a readily usable and reliable scaling criterion for establishing the minimum required power for laser powder bed fusion, applicable to different materials, as well as suggesting viable strategies to adjust the operating parameters towards the defect-free regime.},

	abstract = {Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90\%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.},

However, some keyhole porosity formation mechanisms, e.g., keyhole fluctuation, collapse and bubble growth and shrinkage, remain unclear. Using synchrotron X-ray imaging we reveal keyhole and bubble behaviour, quantifying their formation dynamics. The findings support the hypotheses that: (i) keyhole porosity can initiate not only in unstable, but also in the transition keyhole regimes created by high laser power-velocity conditions, causing fast radial keyhole fluctuations (2.5–10 kHz); (ii) transition regime collapse tends to occur part way up the rear-wall; and (iii) immediately after keyhole collapse, bubbles undergo rapid growth due to pressure equilibration, then shrink due to metal-vapour condensation. Concurrent with condensation, hydrogen diffusion into the bubble slows the shrinkage and stabilises the bubble size. The keyhole fluctuation and bubble evolution mechanisms revealed here may guide the development of control systems for minimising porosity.},

Three kinds of balling mechanisms under different laser processing conditions were proposed. It shows that scanning the initial tracks onto a cold powder bed gives rise to the first line scan balling, due to the high thermal gradients imposed on the melt. Using a higher scan speed leads to the ‘shrinkage-induced balling’, because of a significant capillary instability effect. The ‘self-balling’ prevails at a high laser power combined with a low scan speed, which is ascribed to an excessive liquid formation and a too long liquid lifetime.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection, characterization, and prediction of defects has great potential for immediate impact in the production of fully-dense and defect free metal additive manufacturing (AM) builds. Accordingly, this paper presents Defect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) as a means of quantifying the role of porosity as an exemplary defect structure in powder bed printed materials. Synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (μSXCT) was used to demonstrate that metal AM defects follow predictable trends within processing parameter space for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) materials. Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks were fabricated on an EOS M290 utilizing variations in laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing. In general, characteristic under-melting or lack-of-fusion defects were discovered in the low laser power, high scan velocity region of process space via μSXCT. These defects were associated with insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and can be avoided through the application of a lack-of-fusion criterion using melt pool geometric modeling. Large-scale keyhole defects were also successfully mitigated for estimated melt pool morphologies associated with shallow keyhole front wall angles. Process variable selections resulting in deep keyholes, i.e., high laser power and low scan velocity, exhibit a substantial increase of spherical porosity as compared to the nominal (manufacturer recommended) processing parameters for Ti-6Al-4 V. Defects within fully-dense process space were also discovered, and are associated with gas porosity transfer to the AM test blocks during the laser-powder interaction. Overall, this work points to the fact that large-scale defects in LPBF materials can be successfully predicted and thus mitigated/minimized via appropriate selection of processing parameters.},

In this work, we introduce xVal, a strategy for continuously tokenizing numbers within language models that results in a more appropriate inductive bias for scientific applications. By training specially-modified language models from scratch on a variety of scientific datasets formatted as text, we find that xVal generally outperforms other common numerical tokenization strategies on metrics including out-of-distribution generalization and computational efficiency.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	abstract = {As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into complex real-world environments, there is a growing need for approaches that enable robots to understand and act upon natural language instructions without relying on extensive pre-programmed knowledge of their surroundings. This paper presents PLATO, an innovative system that addresses this challenge by leveraging specialized large language model agents to process natural language inputs, understand the environment, predict tool affordances, and generate executable actions for robotic systems. Unlike traditional systems that depend on hard-coded environmental information, PLATO employs a modular architecture of specialized agents to operate without any initial knowledge of the environment. These agents identify objects and their locations within the scene, generate a comprehensive high-level plan, translate this plan into a series of low-level actions, and verify the completion of each step. The system is particularly tested on challenging tool-use tasks, which involve handling diverse objects and require long-horizon planning. PLATO's design allows it to adapt to dynamic and unstructured settings, significantly enhancing its flexibility and robustness. By evaluating the system across various complex scenarios, we demonstrate its capability to tackle a diverse range of tasks and offer a novel solution to integrate LLMs with robotic platforms, advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous robotic task execution.

A text based description of 326000 molecules were collected using ChatGPT and used to train LLM to learn the representation of molecules.

Experiments show that GPT-MolBERTa performs well on various molecule property benchmarks, and approaching state of the art performance in regression tasks.

With the image processing tools developed in this paper, the extraction of porosity information from raw quality inspection data, such as cross-section images and tomography data sets, can be automated. The CNN models with a compact architecture, part of whose hyperparameters were selected through cross-validation analysis, achieved a classification accuracy of 91.2\% for porosity occurrence detection in the direct laser deposition of sponge Titanium powders and presented predictive capacity for micro pores below 100 μm.

Furthermore, these methods cannot directly consider the effects of AM parameters. In this study, a platform is developed for a data-driven analysis of continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based fatigue life prediction of AM stainless steel (SS) 316L, in which the effects of AM process parameters (including laser power P, scan speed v, hatch space h, powder layer thickness t) are considered. Here, three typical ML models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), and a support vector machine (SVM), are trained effectively by a database produced by the CDM technique, and then further comparisons are made between the predicted results and published experimental data to verify the proposed platform. Finally, detailed parametric studies using the ML models are conducted to investigate some of the significant characteristics.},

We also find that two initial LSTM layers in the Transformer encoder provide a much better positional encoding. Data-augmentation, a variant of SpecAugment, helps to improve both the Transformer by 33\% and the LSTM by 15\% relative. We analyze several pretraining and scheduling schemes, which is crucial for both the Transformer and the LSTM models. We improve our LSTM model by additional convolutional layers.

The influences of hatch spacing (H) on the thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and resultant surface quality of molten pool have been discussed in detail. The results revealed that the H had a significant influence on determining the terminally solidified surface quality of the SLM-processed components. As a relatively lower H of 40μm was used, a considerable amount of molten liquid migrated towards the previous as-fabricated tracks with a higher velocity, resulting in a stacking of molten liquid and the attendant formation of a poor surface quality with a large average surface roughness of 12.72μm. As an appropriate H of 60μm was settled, a reasonable temperature gradient and the resultant surface tension tended to spread the molten liquid with a steady velocity, favoring the formation of a flat surface of the component and an attendant low average surface roughness of 2.23μm. Both the surface morphologies and average surface roughness were experimentally obtained, which were in a full accordance with the results calculated by simulation.},

For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt, have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9\% accuracy using only public training data.},

	abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the most important and successfully additive manufacturing processes in 3D metal printing technologies. Critical quality issues such as porosity, surface roughness, crack, and delamination continue to present challenges within SLM-manufactured parts. Monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis are the key to improving the final part quality. Currently, it greatly hinders the adaptability and the development within the defect detection system since the setup restricts the vision and photo diode applications in the SLM process monitoring. Additionally, defect detection with traditional classification approaches makes the system rather complex due to introducing a series of steps. To meet these needs, this study proposes a novel method for the defect detection within the SLM parts. The setup was flexibly conducted using a microphone, and the defect detection was obtained by the framework of deep belief network (DBN). It is implemented by a simplified classification structure without signal preprocessing and feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the utilization of acoustic signals was workable for quality monitoring, and the DBN approach could reach high defect detection rate among five melted states without signal preprocessing.},

Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with the keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of the keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model incorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect, and Darcy’s law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results are validated with the in situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the instant bubble pinning on the solidification front. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. Additionally, the simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.},

	abstract = {Cobalt chromium is widely used to make medical implants and wind turbine, engine and aircraft components because of its high wear and corrosion resistance. The ability to process geometrically complex components is an area of intense interest to enable shifting from traditional manufacturing techniques to additive manufacturing (AM). The major reason for using AM is to ease design modification and optimization since AM machines can directly apply the changes from an updated STL file to print a geometrically complex object. Quality assurance for AM fabricated parts is recognized as a critical limitation of AM processes. In selective laser melting (SLM), layer by layer melting and remelting can lead to porosity defects caused by lack of fusion, balling, and keyhole collapse. Machine process parameter optimization becomes a very important task and is usually accomplished by producing a large amount of experimental coupons with different combinations of process parameters such as laser power, speed, hatch spacing, and powder layer thickness. In order to save the cost and time of these experimental trial and error methods, many researchers have attempted to simulate defect formation in SLM. Many physics-based assumptions must be made to model these processes, and thus, all the models are limited in some aspects. In the present work, we investigated single bead melt pool shapes for SLM of CoCr to tune the physics assumptions and then, applied to the model to predict bulk lack of fusion porosity within the finished parts. The simulation results were compared and validated against experimental results and show a high degree of correlation.},

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, traditional Fourier decomposition, and statistical measures of the time-series and corresponding frequency spectra were used to extract feature vectors which correlate to keyhole pore formation. Sequential feature selection revealed that measures associated with the acoustic spectra were most useful for identifying pore formations in L-PBF.

	abstract = {With the advance of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, complex designs can be created with engineering metals. One specific advantage of this greater design space is the ability to create small internal channels and passageways for cooling high heat flux or temperature applications such as electronics and gas turbine airfoils. These applications can have complex shapes, which when coupled with the required small channel sizes, make traditional finishing processes a challenge for additively manufactured parts. Therefore, it is desirable for designers to be able to use AM parts with small internal channels that are as-built. To achieve this goal, however, designers must know how the AM process affects internal channel tolerances and roughness levels, since both impact the amount of cooling that can be achieved in actual applications. In this study, the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process, more generically referred to as selective laser melting (SLM), was used to additively manufacture test coupons. The AM build direction was varied to study its effect on small microsized, circular channels. Specifically, X-ray computed tomography (CT-scan) was used to nondestructively inspect the interior of the test coupons. Using the data from the CT-scans, internal surface roughness, geometric tolerances, and deviations from the computer-aided design (CAD) model were calculated. In comparing the data, significant differences were seen between the three different build directions.},

These issues can be alleviated by our proposed NormFormer architecture, which adds three normalization operations to each layer: a Layer Norm after self attention, head-wise scaling of self-attention outputs, and a Layer Norm after the first fully connected layer. The extra operations incur negligible compute cost (+0.4\% parameter increase), but improve pretraining perplexity and downstream task performance for both causal and masked language models ranging from 125 Million to 2.7 Billion parameters. For example, adding NormFormer on top of our strongest 1.3B parameter baseline can reach equal perplexity 24\% faster, or converge 0.27 perplexity better in the same compute budget. This model reaches GPT3-Large (1.3B) zero shot performance 60\% faster. For masked language modeling, NormFormer improves fine-tuned GLUE performance by 1.9\% on average.

	abstract = {As the metal additive manufacturing (AM) industry moves towards industrial production, the need for qualification standards covering all aspects of the technology becomes ever more prevalent. While some standards and specifications for documenting the various aspects of AM processes and materials exist and continue to evolve, many such standards still need to be matured or are under consideration/development within standards development organizations. An important subset of this evolving the standardization domain has to do with critical property measurements for AM materials. While such measurement procedures are well documented, with various legacy standards for conventional metallic material forms such as cast or wrought structural alloys, many fewer standards are currently available to enable systematic evaluation of those properties in AM-processed metallic materials. This is due in part to the current lack of AM-specific standards and specifications for AM materials and processes, which are a logical precursor to the material characterization standards for any material system. This paper summarizes some of the important standardization activities, as well as limitations associated with using currently available standards for metal AM with a focus on measuring mission-critical properties. Technical considerations in support of future standards development, as well as a pathway for qualification/certification of AM parts enabled by the appropriate standardization landscape, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs).
Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood.
The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift".
In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm.
Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother.
This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

Material porosity in these parts is undesirable for aerospace parts - since porosity could lead to premature failure - and desirable for some biomedical implants - since surface-breaking pores allows for better integration with biological tissue. Changes in a part’s porosity during an additive manufacturing build may also be an indication of an undesired change in the build process. Here, we present efforts to develop an ultrasonic sensor for monitoring changes in the porosity in metal parts during fabrication on a metal powder bed fusion system. The development of well-characterized reference samples, measurements of the porosity of these samples with multiple techniques, and correlation of ultrasonic measurements with the degree of porosity are presented. A proposed sensor design, measurement strategy, and future experimental plans on a metal powder bed fusion system are also presented.},

	abstract = {Porosity is an inherent attribute in selective laser melting (SLM) and profoundly degrades the build part quality and its performance. This study attempts to understand and characterize the keyhole pores formed during single-track scanning in SLM. First, 24 single tracks were generated using different line energy density (LED) levels, ranging from 0.1 J/mm to 0.98 J/mm, by varying the laser power and the scanning speed. The samples were then scanned by micro-computed tomography to measure keyhole pores and analyze the pore characteristics. The results show a general trend that the severity of the keyhole porosity increases with the increase of the LED with exceptions of certain patterns, implying important individual contributions from the parameters. Next, by keeping the LED constant in another set of experiments, different combinations of the power and the speed were tested to investigate the individual effect. Based on the results obtained, the laser power appears to have a greater effect than the scanning speed on both the pore number and the pore volume as well as the pore depth. For the same LED, the pore number and volume increase with increasing laser power until a certain critical level, beyond which, both the pore number and volume will decrease, if the power is further increased. For the LED of 0.32 J/mm, 0.4 J/mm, and 0.48 J/mm, the critical laser power that reverses the trend is about 132 W, 140 W, and 144 W, respectively.},

	abstract = {This overview highlights some of the key aspects regarding materials qualification needs across the additive manufacturing (AM) spectrum. AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM. Possible future pathways for materials qualification are provided.},

We assemble tokens from various stages of the vision transformer into image-like representations at various resolutions and progressively combine them into full-resolution predictions using a convolutional decoder. The transformer backbone processes representations at a constant and relatively high resolution and has a global receptive field at every stage. These properties allow the dense vision transformer to provide finer-grained and more globally coherent predictions when compared to fully-convolutional networks. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements on dense prediction tasks, especially when a large amount of training data is available. For monocular depth estimation, we observe an improvement of up to 28\% in relative performance when compared to a state-of-the-art fully-convolutional network. When applied to semantic segmentation, dense vision transformers set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02\% mIoU. We further show that the architecture can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets such as NYUv2, KITTI, and Pascal Context where it also sets the new state of the art.

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has several possible advantages over traditional manufacturing including increased design freedom, reduced material usage, and shorter lead-times. A noteworthy capability of AM is the ability to monitor the process during material deposition and interrupt the process during fabrication if necessary. Recently, such monitoring, feedback, and control have been made possible by implementing in situ infrared (IR) thermography in powder bed fusion AM technologies. The purpose of the current research was to investigate the acquisition of absolute surface temperatures using in situ IR imaging of the melted or solid surfaces layer-by-layer during fabrication within an electron beam melting (EBM) system. The thermal camera was synchronized with the system's signal voltages of three synchronized events (pre-heating, melting, and raking) to automatically capture images. To acquire absolute temperature values from the IR images, a calibration procedure was established to determine the solid material's emissivity and reflected temperature or mean radiant temperature of the build chamber, which are necessary input parameters for the IR camera. A blackbody radiator was fabricated via EBM and was used as a tool to determine the emissivity of Ti–6Al–4V (determined to be 0.26 in the temperature range of the current study). Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to determine the view factors associated with the system's interior (e.g. heat shielding) that were used in calculating the mean radiant temperature of the manufacturing environment (∼342°C). Experimental validation of the model was performed using a thermocouple embedded during fabrication that showed a 3.77\% difference in temperature. A temperature difference of ∼366°C (1038°C vs. 672°C) was observed when comparing uncorrected IR temperature data with corrected temperature data. Upon validation of the IR parameters for a melted area, experimentation was conducted to also determine powder emissivity (found to be 0.50). The thermal model presented here can be modified and implemented in other AM technologies for consideration of radiation energy to acquire absolute temperatures of layered surfaces, leading to improved thermal monitoring and control of the fabrication process.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), an enabler of Industry 4.0, recently opened limitless possibilities in various sectors covering personal, industrial, medical, aviation and even extra-terrestrial applications. Although significant research thrust is prevalent on this topic, a detailed review covering the impact, status, and prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector has been ignored in the literature. Therefore, this review provides comprehensive information on smart mechanisms and systems emphasizing additive, subtractive and/or hybrid manufacturing processes in a collaborative, predictive, decisive, and intelligent environment. Relevant electronic databases were searched, and 248 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis. Our review suggests that significant improvements are required in connectivity, data sensing, and collection to enhance both subtractive and additive technologies, though the pervasive use of AI by machines and software helps to automate processes. An intelligent system is highly recommended in both conventional and non-conventional subtractive manufacturing (SM) methods to monitor and inspect the workpiece conditions for defect detection and to control the machining strategies in response to instantaneous output. Similarly, AM product quality can be improved through the online monitoring of melt pool and defect formation using suitable sensing devices followed by process control using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Challenges in implementing intelligent additive and subtractive manufacturing systems are also discussed in the article. The challenges comprise difficulty in self-optimizing CNC systems considering real-time material property and tool condition, defect detections by in-situ AM process monitoring, issues of overfitting and underfitting data in ML models and expensive and complicated set-ups in hybrid manufacturing processes.},

Various physical characteristics are compared among the FE model, Rosenthal equation, and experiments. The predicted melt pool shapes compared with reported experimental results from the literature show that both the FE model and the analytical (Rosenthal) equation provide a reasonably accurate estimation. At high heat input, under conditions leading to keyholing, the reported melt width is narrower than predicted by the analytical equation. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis based on choices of the absorptivity is performed, which shows that the Rosenthal approach is more sensitive to absorptivity, compared with the FE approach. The primary reason could be the effect of radiative and convective losses, which are assumed to be negligible in the Rosenthal equation. In addition, both methods predict a columnar solidification microstructure, which agrees well with experimental reports, and the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) predicted with the two approaches is comparable with measurements.},

Metal additive manufacturing (AM), a 3D printing technology prone to defects, requires a digital twin capable of tackling issues of printed part qualification, certification and optimisation. In this paper, we evaluate the key features specific to metal AM and review the current literature of modelling, sensing, control and machine intelligence. We find that the body of research toward the development of an metal additive manufacturing (AM) digital twin can be organised logically into a hierarchy of four levels of increasing complexity. The elements composing each level require deep integration and we highlight the key enabling technologies: surrogate modelling, in-situ sensing, hardware control systems and intelligent control policies.

	abstract = {Defects in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) parts often result from the meso-scale dynamics of the molten alloy near the laser, known as the melt pool. For instance, the melt pool can directly contribute to the formation of undesirable porosity, residual stress, and surface roughness in the final part. Experimental in-situ monitoring of the three-dimensional melt pool physical fields is challenging, due to the short length and time scales involved in the process. Multi-physics simulation methods can describe the three-dimensional dynamics of the melt pool, but are computationally expensive at the mesh refinement required for accurate predictions of complex effects, such as the formation of keyhole porosity. Therefore, in this work, we develop a generative deep learning model based on the probabilistic diffusion framework to map low-fidelity, coarse-grained simulation information to the high-fidelity counterpart. By doing so, we bypass the computational expense of conducting multiple high-fidelity simulations for analysis by instead upscaling lightweight coarse mesh simulations. Specifically, we implement a 2-D diffusion model to spatially upscale cross-sections of the coarsely simulated melt pool to their high-fidelity equivalent. We demonstrate the preservation of key metrics of the melting process between the ground truth simulation data and the diffusion model output, such as the temperature field, the melt pool dimensions and the variability of the keyhole vapor cavity. Specifically, we predict the melt pool depth within 3 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ based on low-fidelity input data 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ coarser than the high-fidelity simulations, reducing analysis time by two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Powder-based additive manufacturing techniques provide tools to construct intricate structures that are difficult to manufacture using conventional methods. In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, components are built by selectively melting specific areas of the powder bed, to form the two-dimensional cross-section of the specific part. However, the high occurrence of defects impacts the adoption of this method for precision applications. Therefore, a control policy for dynamically altering process parameters to avoid phenomena that lead to defect occurrences is necessary. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that derives a versatile control strategy for minimizing the likelihood of these defects is presented. The generated control policy alters the velocity of the laser during the melting process to ensure the consistency of the melt pool and reduce overheating in the generated product. The control policy is trained and validated on efficient simulations of the continuum temperature distribution of the powder bed layer under various laser trajectories.},

	abstract = {We introduce an experimental method to image melt pool temperature with a single commercial color camera and compare the results with multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. This approach leverages the principle of two-color (i.e., ratiometric) thermal imaging, which is advantageous because it negates the need for a priori knowledge of melt pool emissivity, plume transmissivity, and the camera’s view factor. The color camera’s ability to accurately measure temperature was validated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) blackbody source and tungsten filament lamp between temperatures of 1600 K and 2800 K. To demonstrate the technique, an off-axis high-speed color camera operating at 22 500 frames per second capturing a 2.8 mm × 2.8 mm area on the build plate was used to image both no-powder and powder single beads on a commercial laser powder bed fusion machine. Melt pool temperature fields for 316L stainless steel at varying processing conditions show peaks between 3300 K and 3700 K depending on the laser power and increased variability in the presence of powder. Measurements of nickel superalloy 718 and Ti-6Al-4V show comparable temperatures, with increased plume obstruction, especially in Ti-6Al-4V due to vaporization of aluminum. Multi-physics CFD models are used to simulate metal melt pools but some parameters such as the accommodation and Fresnel coefficients are not well characterized. Fitting a FLOW-3D® CFD model to ex-situ measurements of the melt pool cross-sectional geometry for 316L stainless steel identifies multiple combinations of Fresnel coefficient and accommodation coefficient that lead to geometric agreement. Only two of these combinations show agreement with the thermal images, motivating the need for thermal imaging as a means to advance validation of complex physics models. Our methodology can be applied to any color camera to better monitor and understand melt pools that yield high-quality parts.},

Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

Here, we report the opposite tendency found in the solidification microstructure of stainless steels partially melted by scanning electron beam for powder bed fusion (PBF)-type additive manufacturing. Equiaxed grains were observed more frequently in the region of high G rather than in the region of low G, contrary to the trend of the CET criterion. Computational thermal-fluid dynamics (CtFD) simulation has revealed that the fluid velocity is significantly higher in the case of smaller melt regions. The G on the solidification front of a small melt pool tends to be high, but at the same, the temperature gradient along the melt pool surface also tends to be high. The high melt surface temperature gradient can enhance Marangoni flow, which can apparently reverse the trend of equiaxed grain formation.},

In this paper, instantaneous anomalous conditions are detected in-situ via pyrometry during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing and correlated with voids observed using post-build micro-computed tomography. Large two-color pyrometry data sets were used to estimate instantaneous temperatures, melt pool orientations and aspect ratios. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to processed pyrometry data to detect outlier images and conditions. It is shown that melt pool outliers are good predictors of voids observed post-build. With this approach, real time process monitoring can be incorporated into systems to detect defect and void formation. Alternatively, using the methodology presented here, pyrometry data can be post processed for porosity assessment.},

	abstract = {Variability and repeatability challenges in Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) limit its industrial applications. The difficulty of effectively evaluating similar defects with varying severity poses reliability issues for in-situ monitoring based on acoustic monitoring. In the LPBF acoustic monitoring scenario, the original signal amplitude is weak, and the acoustic field coupling information is complex, so it is difficult to directly obtain high-quality and physically reasonable LPBF defect features, which leads to the difficulty of reliably monitoring LPBF defects. This study proposes a novel LPBF pore defect monitoring approach based on acoustic signal physical defect information feature extraction and interpretable deep learning. Firstly, based on the established correlation mechanism among the molten pool, defects, and signals in the LPBF process, the effectiveness of acoustic feature representation in reflecting defect information is demonstrated. Secondly, the TFSST method is proposed to enhance the expression of the most relevant and physically reasonable time-frequency features of weak amplitude LPBF defect signals. Finally, the multi-scale spatially interactive fusion convolutional neural network (MSSIF-CNN) is proposed for in-situ monitoring of LPBF defects using an ABAE monitoring system. The proposed method can recognize five LPBF defects with an accuracy of 99.12 \%. In addition, the visualization results verify that the model possesses superior adaptive defect feature extraction capabilities and effectively focuses on the most relevant and physically reasonable defect characterization information. With millisecond monitoring response times and physically interpretable defect monitoring decision-making capabilities, the method offers the potential for industrialized in-situ monitoring.},

These important attributes are now optimized by trial and error because the essential process variables cannot currently be selected from scientific principles. A recourse is to build and rigorously validate a digital twin of the additive manufacturing process that can provide accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variations of metallurgical parameters that affect the structure and properties of components. Key building blocks of a computationally efficient first-generation digital twin of laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing utilize a transient, three-dimensional model that calculates temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates, solidification parameters and deposit geometry. The measured profiles of stainless steel 316L and Alloy 800H deposits as well as the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and Vickers hardness measurements are used to validate the proposed digital twin. The predicted cooling rates, temperature gradients, solidification rates, SDAS and micro-hardness values are shown to be more accurate than those obtained from a commonly used heat conduction calculation. These metallurgical building blocks serve as a phenomenological framework for the development of a digital twin that will make the expanding knowledge base of additive manufacturing usable in a practical way for all scientists and engineers.},

	abstract = {Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) has been extended to multilinguality, that is to handle more than one translation direction with a single system. Multilingual NMT showed competitive performance against pure bilingual systems. Notably, in low-resource settings, it proved to work effectively and efficiently, thanks to shared representation space that is forced across languages and induces a sort of transfer-learning. Furthermore, multilingual NMT enables so-called zero-shot inference across language pairs never seen at training time. Despite the increasing interest in this framework, an in-depth analysis of what a multilingual NMT model is capable of and what it is not is still missing. Motivated by this, our work (i) provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of the translations produced by bilingual, multilingual and zero-shot systems; (ii) investigates the translation quality of two of the currently dominant neural architectures in MT, which are the Recurrent and the Transformer ones; and (iii) quantitatively explores how the closeness between languages influences the zero-shot translation. Our analysis leverages multiple professional post-edits of automatic translations by several different systems and focuses both on automatic standard metrics (BLEU and TER) and on widely used error categories, which are lexical, morphology, and word order errors.},

We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn interesting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple attention.},

To explore the mechanisms of porosity formation at atmospheric pressure and porosity defects mitigation under vacuum, the weld pool and fluid flow behaviors were directly observed by placing a transparent glass plate on one side of the weld pool. The results showed that the vacuum condition was favorable for reducing porosity, especially process porosity. It was also found that the weld pool size and fluid flow were totally different at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. At atmospheric pressure, bubbles were trapped in the vortex induced by two opposing fluid flows, failed to escape from the weld pool and finally formed pores. Under vacuum, suppression of vapor plume and reduction in the boiling point led to a deeper keyhole and a thinner weld pool, resulting in an upward flow in the rear weld pool. In this case, the bubbles could escape easily from the weld pool with the help of the upward flow.},

Understanding the physics behind the complex and dynamic phenomena occurring during these processes is essential for overcoming the barriers that constrain the metal AM development. In-situ synchrotron X-ray characterization is suitable for investigating the microstructure evolution during processing and provides new profound insights. Here, we provide an overview of the research on metal PBF and DED using in-situ synchrotron X-ray imaging, diffraction and small-angle scattering, highlighting the state of the art, the instrumentation, the challenges and the gaps in knowledge that need to be filled.

In this study, a mathematical model which was supported by the data of experimental tests was developed to obtain increased accuracy. Melt pool temperatures were predicted by using the model which consisted of average temperature and extrapolated measurement area approaches. Melt pool temperatures were calculated ranging between 1700 and 2800 °C. Besides, temperature-dependent cooling rate was considered in the model to improve accuracy of temperature measurement. In addition, finite element analysis of manufacturing process was performed to verify results. Comparison between results of the mathematical equations and finite element analysis showed the accuracy as minimum 85\% and maximum 98\%.

	abstract = {The inherent complexity of the fluid flow in subsurface systems brings potential inevitable uncertainty in their characterization. Computationally intensive high-dimensional inversion problems often emerge in solving the fluid flow problems of various scenarios, which required to be probed. To improve the efficiency of solving such problems, surrogate strategies are widely used to quantify the uncertainty of underground multiphase flow models. In this paper, a deep learning surrogate model is developed for predicting the time-dependent dynamic multiphase flow in a two-dimensional (2D) channelized geological system. The surrogate model is combined with a residual U-net and an autoregressive strategy, which considers the output at the previous time step as input and predict the output at the current time step. The residual U-net has a symmetric network structure similar to U-net and contains extra residual units. The rich skip connections in the network can promote information dissemination and achieve better prediction performance with fewer parameters. We demonstrated the performance of the autoregressive residual U-net (AR-Runet) for predicting the migration of solute transport in heterogeneous 2D binary model. The result shows the AR-Runet surrogate model can provide an accurate approximation of saturation and pressure fields at different times. We also have demonstrated that with the autoregressive strategy this network can achieve similar predict results with relatively less training data. The performance of the AR-Runet network is also compared with the autoregressive Dense net (AR-Dense). The findings indicate that the AR-Runet can provide effective measures for developing surrogate model and uncertainty analysis in dynamic multiphase flow predictions of subsurface systems.},

	abstract = {Laser Powder-Bed Fusions (LPBF), a class of additive manufacturing (AM), is a promising technique for producing components with complex geometry design. However, parts fabricated by LPBF suffer from residual stresses arising due to substantial temperature gradients inherent to the process. Numerical models are unable to provide a comprehensive thermal history of the built materials efficiently due to the mismatch between the characteristic length scales and infinitesimal time steps needed for complete simulations. In the present work, an extended Rosenthal’s model is presented by considering the effects of various heat dissipation/consumption mechanisms. The modeling results of energy auditing of thermal boundary conditions for stainless steel (SS17-4PH) laser melting indicated that the total energy losses by convection, radiation, and melting are less than 20\% among which, radiation is the most dominant part. A comparison of the results obtained by the extended Rosenthal’s equation with finite element numerical predictions and experimental data shows a good agreement. Also, a parametric study has been conducted to identify the influence of laser scanning velocity, beam radius, and power on the overall temperature distributions and melt geometry. The present study can pave the way for the prospective use of this methodology to conduct further investigation such as microstructure analysis and thermo-mechanical modeling which are needed to predict residual stresses and distortions.},

A detailed experimental campaign was carried out to characterize the components made through the two additive manufacturing techniques aforementioned and the powders used in the process. It was found that some defects of the final components can be attributed to internal porosities of the powders used in the manufacturing process. These internal porosities are a consequence of the gas atomization process used for the production of the powders themselves. Therefore, the importance of using tailored powders, free from porosities, in order to manufacture components with high mechanical properties is highlighted.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process, a specific part is built in an iterative manner in which two-dimensional cross-sections are formed on top of each other by selectively melting and fusing the desired areas of the powder bed. In this process, the temperature field and melt pool morphology play a major role in the quality of the manufactured part and its possible defects. Therefore, predicting these factors is of high importance. However, simulating such a complex phenomenon is usually very time-consuming and requires huge computational resources. In this work, we create three datasets consisting of single-trail L-PBF processes using the Flow-3D simulation software and use them to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting the three-dimensional temperature field solely by taking the process parameters and the time step as input. The CNN achieves a relative Root Mean Squared Error less of than 5\% for the temperature field in the solidifying region and an average Intersection over Union score of 80\% to 90\% in predicting the three-dimensional geometry of the melt pool. Moreover, since time is included as one of the inputs of the model, the temperature field can be obtained in a matter of a few seconds for any arbitrary time step without the need to iterate and compute all the steps.},

A major goal is to determine the merits and demerits of this analytical equation which can be an alternative to FE analysis, and to evaluate the effect of imperative assumptions on predicted consequences. Using results from the analytical and numerical approaches in conjunction with experiments, different physical features are compared. In this study, the results obtained from experiments in terms of melt pool shapes are compared with the predicted ones achieved from the numerical and analytical approaches in which the FE model is more accurate than the Rosenthal equation in the estimation of the melt pool dimensions. Furthermore, as to the partially melted zones, the estimations achieved from the numerical modeling are more genuine than ones from the analytical equation with regards to the experimental results. At high energy density, near keyhole welding mode, the reported results show that experimental melt widths are supposed to be narrower than the fusion widths estimated by the analytical solution. The primary explanation could be the influence of thermal losses that occurred during convection and radiation, which are neglected in the Rosenthal equation. Additionally, the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) estimated with the numerical modeling and the analytical Rosenthal solution is comparable with the experimental results obtained.},

In this work, surround stereo digital image correlation (DIC) is used to 3D map surfaces and strain tensors in-situ in a powder-blown laser DED system. Infrared thermography is then projected onto these surfaces to record the full thermomechanical history of printed parts. DIC presents a unique challenge to DED AM, as no part exists at the beginning of deposition, which (a) prevents application of an appropriate speckle pattern and (b) denies the user a zero strain reference frame. Solutions to these problems are proposed and their limitations explored herein. In sum, this work presents a relatively low-cost solution to monitoring and optimizing the unique temporal artifacts induced by complex scan strategies that was previously unobtainable.},

An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. This research shall strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research, new plastic powders must still be qualified for laser-based powder bed fusion using trial and error. Furthermore, part properties such as mechanical properties, surface roughness, or density exhibit a comparatively low reproducibility. Recent progress in the field of process monitoring, however, indicates that infrared thermography can be used to correlate melt pool temperatures with the resulting part properties. The analysis of the influence of process parameters on the resulting melt pool temperatures has up until now been limited to the evaluation of the maximum temperature during exposure and the mean temperature at arbitrary moments after exposure. However, the cooling rate of the polymer melt is also essential. To prove this hypothesis, a continuous data stream, which enables an automated calculation of characteristic processing times and temperatures, is introduced within the scope of this work. Single-layer specimens are manufactured with various energy inputs, while the resulting temperature of the melt is recorded using thermal imaging. The peak temperatures are combined with the characteristics that describe the temperature decay after exposure, such as a decay time determined at a specific cooling rate. These metrics quantify the cooling behavior of melt pools in a systematic and reproducible way. Furthermore, the sequence of decay values at different cooling rates can potentially be combined with existing process knowledge to differentiate process regimes. The presented approach can be used to create a more in-depth process understanding in later works, thereby enabling applications such as in-situ quality assurance.},

The most relevant metal AM applications currently involve industrial sectors (e.g. aerospace and bio-medical) where defects avoidance is fundamental. Because of this, there is the need to develop novel in situ monitoring tools able to keep under control the stability of the process on a layer-by-layer basis, and to detect the onset of defects as soon as possible. On the one hand, AM systems must be equipped with in situ sensing devices able to measure relevant quantities during the process, a.k.a. process signatures. On the other hand, in-process data analytics and statistical monitoring techniques are required to detect and localize the defects in an automated way. This paper reviews the literature and the commercial tools for in situ monitoring of powder bed fusion (PBF) processes. It explores the different categories of defects and their main causes, the most relevant process signatures and the in situ sensing approaches proposed so far. Particular attention is devoted to the development of automated defect detection rules and the study of process control strategies, which represent two critical fields for the development of future smart PBF systems.},

Instead, we revisit such analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz., mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons for the success of the heuristics. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA. Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed to the deeper layers.},

In this work, a microstructure process map is presented for deposition of single beads of Ti-6Al4V using an electron beam wire feed process.

	abstract = {We study the impact of different loss functions on lesion segmentation from medical images. Although the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is the most popular option when dealing with natural images, for biomedical image segmentation the soft Dice loss is often preferred due to its ability to handle imbalanced scenarios. On the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully applied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the generalization ability of all these losses in the presence of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time that are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case, we train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we also have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of different loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability to generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation from endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our findings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting in-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data, which leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of problems, due to its robustness and ability to generalize to OoD samples.

This paper demonstrated our preliminary work on the laser powder-bed fusion feedback loop: predict local porosity through in-process monitoring images and machine learning. 3D models were rebuilt from in-situ optical tomography monitoring images and post-build X-ray CT images. They were registered to the original CAD. Dataset for machine learning was assembled from those registered 3D models. The trained machine learning model can precisely predict local porosity caused by lack of fusion and keyhole with multi-layer monitoring images. It also indicates the optimal processing window. It is impossible to be sure about the occurrence of defects in a layer based only on the abnormality of a single layer, and vice versa. Defects in a layer can be caused by improper parameters or anomalies in current layer or subsequent layers; defects in one layer can also be eliminated by proper parameters in the following layers. The work laid the basis for the next step feedback loop control of pore defect.},

	abstract = {The possibility of using a variety of sensor signals acquired during metal powder bed fusion processes, to support part and process qualification and for the early detection of anomalies and defects, has been continuously attracting an increasing interest. The number of research studies in this field has been characterised by significant growth in the last few years, with several advances and new solutions compared with first seminal works. Moreover, industrial powder bed fusion (PBF) systems are increasingly equipped with sensors and toolkits for data collection, visualisation and, in some cases, embedded in-process analysis. Many new methods have been proposed and defect detection capabilities have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, several challenges and open issues still need to be tackled to bridge the gap between methods proposed in the literature and actual industrial implementation. This paper presents an updated review of the literature on in-situ sensing, measurement and monitoring for metal PBF processes, with a classification of methods and a comparison of enabled performances. The study summarises the types and sizes of defects that are practically detectable while the part is being produced and the research areas where additional technological advances are currently needed.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to achieve the defect-free production of parts made using Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. As a step towards this goal, the objective is to detect flaws in AM parts during the process by combining predictions from a physical model (simulation) with in-situ sensor signatures in a machine learning framework. We hypothesize that flaws in AM parts are detected with significantly higher statistical fidelity (F-score) when both in-situ sensor data and theoretical predictions are pooled together in a machine learning model, compared to an approach that is based exclusively on machine learning of sensor data (black-box model) or physics-based predictions (white-box model). We test the hypothesized efficacy of such a gray-box model or digital twin approach in the context of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) AM processes. For example, in the DED process, we first predicted the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature in a thin-wall titanium alloy part using a computational heat transfer model based on graph theory. Subsequently, we combined the preceding physics-derived thermal trends with in-situ temperature measurements obtained from a pyrometer in a readily implemented supervised machine learning framework (support vector machine). We demonstrate that the integration of temperature predictions from an ab initio heat transfer model and in-situ sensor data is capable of detecting flaws in the DED-produced thin-wall part with F-score approaching 90\%. By contrast, the F-score decreases to nearly 80\% when either temperature measurements from the in-situ sensor or temperature distribution predictions from the theoretical model are used alone by themselves. This work thus demonstrates an early foray into the digital twin paradigm for real-time process monitoring in AM via seamless integration of physics-based modeling (simulation), in-situ sensing, and data analytics (machine learning).},

	abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED) is a metal additive manufacturing process, where dimensional accuracy and repeatability are traditionally challenging to achieve. Strategies for computationally inexpensive process modelling and fast-response process controls of the laser deposition process are necessary to keep the geometric features close to the required dimensional tolerances. The deposition geometry depends highly on the complex local laser-material interaction and global thermal history of the substrate. In order to control the deposition geometry, an accurate and computationally inexpensive discretized state space thermal history model coupled with an analytical deposition geometry model is developed in this work. The model accounts for the local laser-material interaction using the mass and energy equilibrium equations coupled in a lumped parameter solution, as well as the global thermal history of the product using a state space thermomechanical discretization. In literature, studies have only focused on 1D toolpaths with constant process parameters such as speed, powder feedrate, and laser power. As it is possible to achieve highly complex geometric shapes with additive manufacturing, it is important to have models compatible with 2D/3D complex toolpaths. In this paper, an analytical thermomechanical model and a coupled deposition geometry model for DED process are presented and experimentally validated. As such, the thermal history of the deposited part is predicted throughout the process and the geometric features are predicted for 2D toolpaths.},

Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.},

A qualitative action research study has been performed, using the development of an AM rocket engine turbine demonstrator as a case study. The results show that the qualification approach should be developed for the specific application, dependent on the AM knowledge within the organization. AM knowledge is not only linked to the AM process but to the complete AM process chain. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the manufacturing chain during design and to develop necessary knowledge concurrently with the product in order to define suitable requirements. The paper proposes a Design for Qualification framework, supported by six design tactics. The framework encourages proactive consideration for qualification and the capabilities of the AM process chain, as well as the continuous development of AM knowledge during product development.},

There is great potential to design the additive manufacturing process, tailoring process variables based on user requirements for a given part. In this work, the tradeoffs between multiple process outcomes are formalized and the design problem is explored throughout the design space of process variables.

Limited by the implementation conditions, CT with incomplete projections happens quite often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms are not easy to deal with incomplete data. They are usually involved with complicated parameter selection operations, also sensitive to noise and time-consuming. In this paper, we reported a deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data CT. It is the tight coupling of the deep learning U-net and CT reconstruction algorithm in the domain of the projection sinograms. The U-net estimated results are not the artifacts caused by the incomplete data, but the complete projection sinograms. After training, this framework is determined and can reconstruct the final high quality CT image from a given incomplete projection sinogram. Taking the sparse-view and limited-angle CT as examples, this framework has been validated and demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data sets. Embedded with CT reconstruction, this framework naturally encapsulates the physical imaging model of CT systems and is easy to be extended to deal with other challenges.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the porosity distribution and morphology of selective laser melted rotation bending test samples before and after shot peening by means of micro-tomography analysis. The as-built samples show porosity clusters close to the surface, which are attributed to the contour-core scan strategy. In the following steps the effect of shot peening on pore size and morphology in dependency of depth was examined. A strong porosity shrinkage could be achieved in near-surface areas (0–500 μm), but also in depths that did not seem accessible via shot peening, leading to an overall relative porosity reduction between 15–30\%. Furthermore, shot peening led to a pore sphericity increase, especially for large pores. The individual orientation of the pores were compared before and after shot peening, where the former mostly had their longest axis in surface normal direction, while the latter showed a more randomly orientation distribution. X-ray diffractography detected residual compressive stresses for the as-built as well as the shot peened samples. Finally fatigue tests were performed, indicating an increase in low- and high-cycle-fatigue resistance after shot peening by 20 MPa.},

Some high-end users are, however, struggling with the complexity, consistency and cost associated with the qualification of high-end products built using the technique. In-situ process monitoring is a promising means to accommodate this issue, but quantitative correlations between monitoring signals and actual part defects have been lacking. In this paper, results are presented that have been obtained with an off-axis melt pool monitoring system on a 3D Systems ProX DMP 320 using Ti-6Al-4 V ELI. The focus is on the development of a method for predicting the presence and location of lack of fusion porosities as they can have a large impact on part quality and are not always easily detected post-build. The processed signals from the monitoring system are shown to have a high degree of correlation with the presence of lack of fusion porosities as measured by CT scans. A prediction sensitivity of 90\% for lack of fusion events in the range of pores having a volume greater than 0.001 mm3, roughly equivalent to 160 μm in diameter, was obtained.},

It begins with introducing fundamentals of metal AM qualification and certification. Thereafter, the status of standards, rules, and regulations developed by international organisations and communities is summarised and discussed.

	abstract = {Recognizing a target of interest from the UAVs is much more challenging than the existing object re-identification tasks across multiple city cameras. The images taken by the UAVs usually suffer from significant size difference when generating the object bounding boxes and uncertain rotation variations. Existing methods are usually designed for city cameras, incapable of handing the rotation issue in UAV scenarios. A straightforward solution is to perform the image-level rotation augmentation, but it would cause loss of useful information when inputting the powerful vision transformer as patches. This motivates us to simulate the rotation operation at the patch feature level, proposing a novel rotation invariant vision transformer (RotTrans). This strategy builds on high-level features with the help of the specificity of the vision transformer structure, which enhances the robustness against large rotation differences. In addition, we design invariance constraint to establish the relationship between the original feature and the rotated features, achieving stronger rotation invariance. Our proposed transformer tested on the latest UAV datasets greatly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, which is 5.9\% and 4.8\% higher than the highest mAP and Rank1. Notably, our model also performs competitively for the person re-identification task on traditional city cameras. In particular, our solution wins the first place in the UAV-based person re-recognition track in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition held in ICCV 2021.

	abstract = {Material Extrusion (ME) is becoming one of the most promising class of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes in the manufacturing panorama for its capability of realizing products with complex shapes, potentially in large dimensions, for a variety of applications and materials for different industrial sectors. Despite the significant advances in material range and machine capabilities, the lack of process stability and repeatability of ME still represents an obstacle for the adoption of this process on large industrial scales. Following the success of in-situ monitoring in other AM technologies, some studies are investigating the possibility of embedding in-situ sensors on commercial machines. Among them, thermal infrared monitoring systems have gained lots of interest for the crucial role of temperature evolution in final part quality and mechanical performance. This study presents a data-driven methodology for in-situ monitoring of thermal profiles. The proposed algorithm extracts, models, and compares the cooling history at different locations. By combining a tracking algorithm and automatic detection of region of interests and robust regression for functional data modeling, we propose a solution to study the cooling history of the 3D printed geometry as the process evolves, to draw general conclusions on the process and detect anomalous thermal profiles, which may entail lack of bonding or other flaws. This paper further proposes a novel approach to automatically detect local temperature inhomogeneities, also known as “hot” and “cold spots”, which are often symptomatic of critical defects in the 3D printed part. In-situ detection of hold- and cold-spots can be particularly useful for large scale products or functional products printing. The proposed methods can be applied to any ME process, but it is specifically applied to a real case study of Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show the effectiveness of all the proposed solutions and pave the way towards zero-defects production.},

If the magnitude of different transformations does not exceed a class- and transformation dependent threshold, both architectures show invariant behavior. In this work we furthermore introduce a new learnable module, the Invariant Transformer Net, which enables us to learn differentiable parameters for a set of affine transformations. This allows us to extract the space of transformations to which the CNN is invariant and its class prediction robust.},

Short layer build times do not provide enough time for the material to cool sufficiently. As a result, an object cannot support its own weight nor deal with overhanging features. Additionally, the generation of support structures may be impractical either due to geometry or, in the case of large-scale polymer additive manufacturing, due to being difficult to remove. To address these issues, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated the use of a thermal camera mounted to a gantry to collect data on an object under construction. This data provided feedback for an in-situ control system to adjust layer build times. Adjustments were made in the form of additional waiting to allow the material to cool to specific thermal thresholds. This additional cooling time allowed the construction of objects with low layer build times or overhanging features that would have otherwise failed.},

This paper presents a novel approach to quantify the distortions experimentally and to use the results in numerical simulation validation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is applied together with optical filters to measure in-situ distortions directly on a wall geometry produced with LMD. The wall shows cyclic expansion and shrinking with the edges bending inward and the top of the sample exhibiting a slight u‐shape as residual distortions. Subsequently, a structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the experiment is established, calibrated against experimental temperature profiles and used to predict the in-situ distortions of the sample. A comparison of the experimental and numerical results reveals a good agreement in length direction of the sample and quantitative deviations in height direction, which are attributed to the material model used. The suitability of the novel experimental approach for measurements on an AM sample is shown and the potential for the validated numerical model as a predictive tool to reduce trial-and-error and improve part quality is evaluated.},

We address these limitations with a method for data augmentation, based on the introduction of random elastic deformations on images of mammograms. We validate this method on three publicly available datasets. Our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is trained for mass classification - in a conventional way -, and then used in the more interesting problem of mass detection in full mammograms by transforming the CNN into a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).},

To address defects during object construction, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100\% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50\% overfill. Within two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10\% of the expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system can compensate for uneven build surfaces.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

In order to handle the long sequences of tokens encountered in video, we propose several, efficient variants of our model which factorise the spatial- and temporal-dimensions of the input. Although transformer-based models are known to only be effective when large training datasets are available, we show how we can effectively regularise the model during training and leverage pretrained image models to be able to train on comparatively small datasets. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics 400 and 600, Epic Kitchens, Something-Something v2 and Moments in Time, outperforming prior methods based on deep 3D convolutional networks. To facilitate further research, we release code at https://github.com/google-research/scenic/tree/main/scenic/projects/vivit},

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing looks back on a history of about two decades and today SLM® technology keeps moving as an integral element in industrial production environments. Sensitive markets such as energy, medical or aerospace have the highest quality standards for complex, safety-related and highly stressed components which are to be met at competitive costs for each build job and single part. In this context process monitoring is necessary for documentation, qualification and at the same time it is expected to be able to detect process anomalies during the process. In addition to surface roughness, part density which mostly depends on volume energy, changing with laser power, scan velocity etc., is a distinctive quality feature of every component. This paper presents a method for a real time melt pool monitoring system based on photodiodes and the correlation between thermal emission and part density of Inconel® 718 with respect to volume energy deviation.},

	abstract = {Characterizing melt pool shape and geometry is essential in Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) to control the printing process, and avoid defects. Predicting melt pool flaws based on process parameters and powder material is difficult due to the complex nature of MAM processes. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be useful in connecting process parameters to the type of flaws in the melt pool. In this work, we introduced a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for melt pool characterization. An extensive experimental dataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM processing conditions, materials, melt pool dimensions, melt pool modes and flaw types. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for melt pool defect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt pool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate melt pool geometry from process parameters and material properties. These models have been shown to outperform Rosenthal estimation for melt pool geometry while maintaining interpretability.},

	abstract = {Lack-of-fusion flaws can occur in powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing of metal components. This paper demonstrates a method for detecting such flaws by monitoring the fabrication of every layer before and after laser scanning with high resolution optical imaging. A binary template is created from the sliced 3D model of the part. Using this template the optical image data is indexed to the part geometry. The indexed image data is used to detect anomalies in the powder layer before laser scanning and in the solidified material after scanning. Lack-of-fusion defects are identified from optical data by correlating multiple images with different lighting conditions and from multiple layers. To test the algorithms intentional defects are created inside a test part at different locations and are successfully detected with a high true positive rate.},

Since the DT is a quite novel concept requiring a wide framework of various technologies, it is not state of the art yet, though. Especially the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) methods is still challenging. Applying the methodology of the systematic review, the state of the art regarding the DT in AM with emphasis of required technologies and current challenges is assessed. Furthermore, the topic of AI is investigated focusing the main applications in AM as well as the possibility to integrate today’s approaches into a DT environment.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is making dense and defect-free components. These porosity defects are dependent upon the melt pool geometry and the processing conditions. Power-velocity (PV) processing maps can aid in visualizing the effects of LPBF processing variables and mapping different defect regimes such as lack-of-fusion, under-melting, balling, and keyholing. This work presents an assessment of existing analytical equations and models that provide an estimate of the melt pool geometry as a function of material properties. The melt pool equations are then combined with defect criteria to provide a quick approximation of the PV processing maps for a variety of materials. Finally, the predictions of these processing maps are compared with experimental data from the literature. The predictive processing maps can be computed quickly and can be coupled with dimensionless numbers and high-throughput (HT) experiments for validation. The present work provides a boundary framework for designing the optimal processing parameters for new metals and alloys based on existing analytical solutions.},
